abstract = {The Marching Cubes algorithm is arguably the most popular isosurface extraction algorithm. Since its inception, two problems have lingered, namely, triangle quality and topology correctness. Although there is an extensive literature to solve them, topology correctness is achieved in detriment of triangle quality and vice versa. In this paper, we present an extended version of the Marching Cubes 33 algorithm (a variation of the Marching Cubes algorithm which guarantees topological correctness), called Extended Marching Cubes 33. In the proposed algorithm, the grid vertex are labeled with ``+,'' `` −,'' and ``=,'' according to the relationship between its scalar field value and the isovalue. The inclusion of the ``='' grid vertex label naturally avoids degenerate triangles. As an application of our method, we use the proposed triangulation to improve the quality of the triangles in the generated mesh while preserving its topology as much as possible.},

abstract = {Hierarchical multi-organ statistical atlases are constructed with the aim of achieving fully automated segmentation of the liver and related organs from computed tomography images. Constraints on inter-relations among organs are embedded in hierarchical organization of probabilistic atlases (PAs) and statistical shape models (SSMs). Hierarchical PAs are constructed based on the hierarchical nature of inter-organ relationships. Multi-organ SSMs (MO-SSMs) are combined with previously proposed single-organ multi-level SSMs (ML-SSMs). A hierarchical segmentation procedure is then formulated using the constructed hierarchical atlases. The basic approach consists of hierarchical recursive processes of initial region extraction using PAs and subsequent refinement using ML/MO-SSMs. The experimental results show that segmentation accuracy of the liver was improved by incorporating constraints on inter-organ relationships.},

abstract = {Vascular exploration of small animals requires imaging hardware with a very high spatial resolution, capable of differentiating large as well as small vessels, in both in vivo and ex vivo studies. Micro Computed Tomography (micro-CT) has emerged in recent years as the preferred modality for this purpose, providing high resolution 3D volumetric data suitable for analysis, quantification, validation, and visualization of results. The usefulness of micro-CT, however, can be adversely affected by a range of factors including physical animal preparation, numerical quantification, visualization of results, and quantification software with limited possibilities. Exacerbating these inherent difficulties is the lack of a unified standard for micro-CT imaging. Most micro-CT today is aimed at particular applications and the software tools needed for quantification, developed mainly by imaging hardware manufacturers, lack the level of detail needed to address more specific aims. This review highlights the capabilities of micro-CT for vascular exploration, describes the current state of imaging protocols, and offers guidelines and suggestions aimed at making micro-CT more accurate, replicable, and robust.},

@article{Aljabar2009,
abstract = {Quantitative research in neuroimaging often relies on anatomical segmentation of human brain MR images. Recent multi-atlas based approaches provide highly accurate structural segmentations of the brain by propagating manual delineations from multiple atlases in a database to a query subject and combining them. The atlas databases which can be used for these purposes are growing steadily. We present a framework to address the consequent problems of scale in multi-atlas segmentation. We show that selecting a custom subset of atlases for each query subject provides more accurate subcortical segmentations than those given by non-selective combination of random atlas subsets. Using a database of 275 atlases, we tested an image-based similarity criterion as well as a demographic criterion (age) in a leave-one-out cross-validation study. Using a custom ranking of the database for each subject, we combined a varying number n of atlases from the top of the ranked list. The resulting segmentations were compared with manual reference segmentations using Dice overlap. Image-based selection provided better segmentations than random subsets (mean Dice overlap 0.854 vs. 0.811 for the estimated optimal subset size, n = 20). Age-based selection resulted in a similar marked improvement. We conclude that selecting atlases from large databases for atlas-based brain image segmentation improves the accuracy of the segmentations achieved. We show that image similarity is a suitable selection criterion and give results based on selecting atlases by age that demonstrate the value of meta-information for selection. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Crossno2002,
abstract = {Presents a new approach to isosurface extraction from volume data using particle systems. Particle behavior is dynamic and can be based on laws of physics or artificial rules. For isosurface extraction, we program particles to be attracted towards a specific surface value while simultaneously repelling adjacent particles. The repulsive forces are based on the curvature of the surface at that location. A birth-death process results in a denser concentration of particles in areas of high curvature and sparser populations in areas of lower curvature. The overall level of detail is controlled through a scaling factor that increases or decreases the repulsive forces of the particles. Once particles reach equilibrium, their locations are used as vertices in generating a triangular mesh of the surface. The advantages of our approach include: vertex densities are based on surface features rather than on the sampling rate of the volume; a single scaling factor simplifies level-of-detail control; and meshing is efficient because it uses neighbor information that has already been generated during the force calculations.},

abstract = {Decision trees are attractive classifiers due to their high execution speed. But trees derived with traditional methods often cannot be grown to arbitrary complexity for possible loss of generalization accuracy on unseen data. The limitation on complexity usually means suboptimal accuracy on training data. Following the principles of stochastic modeling, we propose a method to construct tree-based classifiers whose capacity can be arbitrarily expanded for increases in accuracy for both training and unseen data. The essence of the method is to build multiple trees in randomly selected subspaces of the feature space. Trees in, different subspaces generalize their classification in complementary ways, and their combined classification can be monotonically improved. The validity of the method is demonstrated through experiments on the recognition of handwritten digits},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a new method for surface extraction from volume data which preserves sharp features, maintains consistent topology and generates surface adaptively without crack patching. Our approach is based on the marching cubes algorithm, a popular method to convert volumetric data to polygonal meshes. The original marching cubes algorithm suffers from problems of topological inconsistency, cracks in adaptive resolution and inability to preserve sharp features. Most of marching cubes variants only focus on one or some of these problems. Although these techniques could be combined to solve these problems altogether, such a combination might not be straightforward. Moreover, some feature-preserving variants introduce an additional problem, inter-cell dependency. Our method provides a relatively simple and easy-to-implement solution to all these problems by convening 3D marching cubes into 2D cubical marching squares, resolving topology ambiguity with sharp features and eliminating inter-cell dependency by sampling face sharp features. We compare our algorithm with other marching cubes variants and demonstrate its effectiveness on various applications. {\textcopyright} The Eurographics Association and Blackwell Publishing 2005.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Due to the increasing number of liver cancer cases in clinical practice, there is a significant need for efficient tools for computer-assisted liver lesion analysis. A wide range of clinical applications, such as lesion characterization, quantification and follow-up, can be facilitated by automated liver lesion detection. Liver lesions vary significantly in size, shape, density and heterogeneity, which make them difficult to detect automatically. The goal of this work was to develop a method that can detect all types of liver lesions with high sensitivity and low false positive rate within a short run time. METHODS: The proposed method identifies abnormal regions in liver CT images based on their intensity using a multi-level segmentation approach. The abnormal regions are analyzed from the inside-out using basic geometric features (such as asymmetry, compactness or volume). Using this multi-level shape characterization, the abnormal regions are classified into lesions and other region types (including vessel, liver boundary). The proposed analysis also allows defining the contour of each finding. The method was trained on a set of 55 cases involving 120 lesions and evaluated on a set of 30 images involving 59 (various types of) lesions, which were manually contoured by a physician. RESULTS: The proposed algorithm demonstrated a high detection rate (92 {\%}) at a low (1.7) false positive per case (precision 51 {\%}), when the method was started from a manually contoured liver. The same level of false positive per case (1.6) and precision (51 {\%}) was achieved at a somewhat lower detection rate (85 {\%}), when the volume of interest was defined by a fully automated liver segmentation. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method can efficiently detect liver lesions irrespective of their size, shape, density and heterogeneity within half a minute. According to the evaluation, its accuracy is competitive with the actual state-of-the-art approaches, and the contour of the detected findings is acceptable in most of the cases. Future work shall focus on more precise lesion contouring so that the proposed method can be a solid basis for fully automated liver tumour burden estimation.},

abstract = {This study investigates the reproducibility of the reconstructed image sharpness, after modifications of the geometry setup, for a variable magnification micro-CT ($\mu$CT) scanner. All the measurements were performed on a novel engineered $\mu$CT scanner for in vivo imaging of small animals (Xalt), which has been recently built at the Institute of Clinical Physiology of the National Research Council (IFC-CNR, Pisa, Italy), in partnership with the University of Pisa. The Xalt scanner is equipped with an integrated software for on-line geometric recalibration, which will be used throughout the experiments. In order to evaluate the losses of image quality due to modifications of the geometry setup, we have made 22 consecutive acquisitions by changing alternatively the system geometry between two different setups (Large FoV - LF, and High Resolution - HR). For each acquisition, the tomographic images have been reconstructed before and after the on-line geometric recalibration. For each reconstruction, the image sharpness was evaluated using two different figures of merit: (i) the percentage contrast on a small bar pattern of fixed frequency (f = 5.5 lp/mm for the LF setup and f = 10 lp/mm for the HR setup) and (ii) the image entropy. We have found that, due to the small-scale mechanical uncertainty (in the order of the voxel size), a recalibration is necessary for each geometric setup after repositioning of the system's components; the resolution losses due to the lack of recalibration are worse for the HR setup (voxel size = 18.4 $\mu$m). The integrated on-line recalibration algorithm of the Xalt scanner allowed to perform the recalibration quickly, by restoring the spatial resolution of the system to the reference resolution obtained after the initial (off-line) calibration.},

abstract = {This paper aims to present a review of recent as well as classic image registration methods. Image registration is the process of overlaying images (two or more) of the same scene taken at different times, from different viewpoints, and/or by different sensors. The registration geometrically align two images (the reference and sensed images). The reviewed approaches are classified according to their nature (area-based and feature-based) and according to four basic steps of image registration procedure: feature detection, feature matching, mapping function design, and image transformation and resampling. Main contributions, advantages, and drawbacks of the methods are mentioned in the paper. Problematic issues of image registration and outlook for the future research are discussed too. The major goal of the paper is to provide a comprehensive reference source for the researchers involved in image registration, regardless of particular application areas. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Rohan2018a,
abstract = {The paper deals with modeling the liver perfusion intended to improve quantitative analysis of the tissue scans provided by the contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT). For this purpose, we developed a model of dynamic transport of the contrast fluid through the hierarchies of the perfusion trees. Conceptually, computed time-space distributions of the so-called tissue density can be compared with the measured data obtained from CT; such a modeling feedback can be used for model parameter identification. The blood flow is characterized at several scales for which different models are used. Flows in upper hierarchies represented by larger branching vessels are described using simple 1D models based on the Bernoulli equation extended by correction terms to respect the local pressure losses. To describe flows in smaller vessels and in the tissue parenchyma, we propose a 3D continuum model of porous medium defined in terms of hierarchically matched compartments characterized by hydraulic permeabilities. The 1D models corresponding to the portal and hepatic veins are coupled with the 3D model through point sources, or sinks. The contrast fluid saturation is governed by transport equations adapted for the 1D and 3D flow models. The complex perfusion model has been implemented using the finite element and finite volume methods. We report numerical examples computed for anatomically relevant geometries of the liver organ and of the principal vascular trees. The simulated tissue density corresponding to the CT examination output reflects a pathology modeled as a localized permeability deficiency.},

abstract = {A proper geometric model of the vascular systems in the liver is crucial for modeling blood flow, the connection between the organ and the rest of the organism. In vivo imaging does not provide sufficient details, so an algorithmic concept for extending measured vascular tree data is needed such that geometrically realistic structures can be generated. We develop a quantification of similarity in terms of different geometric features. This involves topological Strahler ordering of the vascular trees, statistical testing, and averaging. Invariant features are identified in human clinical in vivo CT scans. Results of the existing "Constrained Constructive Optimization" algorithm are compared to real vascular tree data. To improve bifurcation angles in the algorithmic results, we implement a postprocessing step calibrated to the measured features. This framework is finally applied to generate realistic additional details in a patient-specific hepatic vascular tree data set.},

abstract = {Automatic image processing methods are a prerequisite to efficiently analyze the large amount of image data produced by computed tomography (CT) scanners during cardiac exams. This paper introduces a model-based approach for the fully automatic segmentation of the whole heart (four chambers, myocardium, and great vessels) from 3-D CT images. Model adaptation is done by progressively increasing the degrees-of-freedom of the allowed deformations. This improves convergence as well as segmentation accuracy. The heart is first localized in the image using a 3-D implementation of the generalized Hough transform. Pose misalignment is corrected by matching the model to the image making use of a global similarity transformation. The complex initialization of the multicompartment mesh is then addressed by assigning an affine transformation to each anatomical region of the model. Finally, a deformable adaptation is performed to accurately match the boundaries of the patient's anatomy. A mean surface-to-surface error of 0.82 mm was measured in a leave-one-out quantitative validation carried out on 28 images. Moreover, the piecewise affine transformation introduced for mesh initialization and adaptation shows better interphase and interpatient shape variability characterization than commonly used principal component analysis.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Statistical shape models (SSMs) represent morphological variations of a specific object. When there are large shape variations, the shape parameters constitute a large space that may include incorrect parameters. The human liver is a non-rigid organ subject to large deformations due to external forces or body position changes during scanning procedures. We developed and tested a population-based model to represent the shape of liver. METHODS: Upper abdominal CT-scan input images are represented by a conventional shape model. The shape parameters of individual livers extracted from the CT scans are employed to classify them into different populations. Corresponding to each population, an SSM model is built. The liver surface parameter space is divided into several subspaces which are more compact than the original space. The proposed model was tested using 29 CT-scan liver image data sets. The method was evaluated by model compactness, reconstruction error, generality and specificity measures. RESULTS: The proposed model is implemented and tested using CT scans that included liver shapes with large shape variations. The method was compared with conventional and recently developed shape modeling methods. The accuracy of the proposed model was nearly twice that achieved with the conventional model. The proposed population-based model was more general compared with the conventional model. The mean reconstruction error of the proposed model was 0.029 mm while that of the conventional model was 0.052 mm. CONCLUSION: A population-based model to represent the shape of liver was developed and tested with favorable results. Using this approach, the liver shapes from CT scans were modeled by a more compact, more general, and more accurate model.},

abstract = {This paper presents an automated multi-organ segmentation method for 3D abdominal CT images based on a spatially-divided probabilistic atlases. Most previous abdominal organ segmentation methods are ineffective to deal with the large differences among patients in organ shape and position in local areas. In this paper, we propose an automated multi-organ segmentation method based on a spatially-divided probabilistic atlas, and solve this problem by introducing a scale hierarchical probabilistic atlas. The algorithm consists of image-space division and a multi-scale weighting scheme. The generated spatial-divided probabilistic atlas efficiently reduces the inter-subject variance in organ shape and position either in global or local regions. Our proposed method was evaluated using 100 abdominal CT volumes with manually traced ground truth data. Experimental results showed that it can segment the liver, spleen, pancreas, and kidneys with Dice similarity indices of 95.1{\%}, 91.4{\%}, 69.1{\%}, and 90.1{\%}, respectively.},

abstract = {Understanding mechanisms causing pulmonary vascular disease (PVD) frequently requires a thorough understanding of the underlying structural changes in the pulmonary circulation. Animal models have been used extensively to study different forms of PVD but conventional experimental techniques are limited in their ability to allow the study of the whole pulmonary vasculature at once. In this study, we introduce novel techniques of arterial casting, high-resolution imaging and tree analysis to study the pulmonary circulation in rodent models. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were used at 20, 36, 52, 100 and 160 days of age. A technique involving arterial casting with Microfil silicone polymer, high-resolution micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) at 12.5 $\mu$m resolution and image data analysis involving segmentation and skeletonization was developed to both qualitatively and quantitatively describe the changes in the pulmonary vasculature with increasing age. Parameters identified to affect the quality of pulmonary arterial casting included polymer flow rate, total injected volume, polymer viscosity and polymerization time. By optimizing these parameters, we successfully created arterial casts of the pulmonary circulation in rats of different ages and demonstrated the feasibility of quantitatively characterizing the changes in the number of vessels with postnatal growth. These preliminary data suggest that the number of vessels with lumen diameters of 50-200 $\mu$m increases rapidly in both lungs between 52 and 100 days of age. With this new technique, the pulmonary vasculature can now be studied in a whole lung animal model to better understand the global effects of disease on vascular structure.},

abstract = {Hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) is experiencing a revival in organ preservation due to the limitations of static cold storage and the need for better preservation of expanded criteria donor organs. For livers, perfusion protocols are still poorly defined, and damage of sinusoidal endothelial cells and heterogeneous perfusion are concerns. In this study, an electrical model of the human liver blood circulation is developed to enlighten internal pressure and flow distributions during HMP. Detailed vascular data on two human livers, obtained by combining vascular corrosion casting, micro-CT-imaging and image processing, were used to set up the electrical model. Anatomical data could be measured up to 5--6 vessel generations in each tree and showed exponential trend lines, used to predict data for higher generations. Simulated flow and pressure were in accordance with literature data. The model was able to simulate effects of pressure-driven HMP on liver hemodynamics and reproduced observations such as flow competition between the hepatic artery and portal vein. Our simulations further indicate that, from a pure biomechanical (shear stress) standpoint, HMP with low pressures should not result in organ damage, and that fluid viscosity has no effect on the shear stress experienced by the liver microcirculation in pressure-driven HMP.},

abstract = {Image-based precision medicine techniques can be used to better treat cancer patients. However, the gigapixel res-olution of Whole Slide Histopathological Images (WSIs) makes traditional survival models computationally impos-sible. These models usually adopt manually labeled dis-criminative patches from region of interests (ROIs) and are unable to directly learn discriminative patches from WSIs. We argue that only a small set of patches cannot fully repre-sent the patients' survival status due to the heterogeneity of tumor. Another challenge is that survival prediction usually comes with insufficient training patient samples. In this pa-per, we propose an effective Whole Slide Histopathological Images Survival Analysis framework (WSISA) to overcome above challenges. To exploit survival-discriminative pat-terns from WSIs, we first extract hundreds of patches from each WSI by adaptive sampling and then group these im-ages into different clusters. Then we propose to train an ag-gregation model to make patient-level predictions based on cluster-level Deep Convolutional Survival (DeepConvSurv) prediction results. Different from existing state-of-the-arts image-based survival models which extract features using some patches from small regions of WSIs, the proposed framework can efficiently exploit and utilize all discrimina-tive patterns in WSIs to predict patients' survival status. To the best of our knowledge, this has not been shown before. We apply our method to the survival predictions of glioma and non-small-cell lung cancer using three datasets. Re-sults demonstrate the proposed framework can significantly improve the prediction performance compared with the ex-isting state-of-the-arts survival methods.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: In liver surgery, preoperative planning is usually performed by using CT scans. Ultrasonic probes are frequently used operatively to verify tissue deformations, for example when resecting a liver tumor with an ultrasonic dissector. Avoidance of dissecting vitally important hepatic vessels and the recrudescence of tumors are of crucial importance. The potential benefits of real-time image navigation in operative liver surgery were investigated experimentally.

METHODS: Four model tumors with realistic ultrasonic features have been embedded into a bowl filled with candle gel. The aim was to locate these tumors with the ultrasonic probe and to puncture them safely with the ultrasonic dissector. The experiment was performed four times, once completely without navigation and three times with ultrasonic-based navigation but under different preconditions.

RESULTS: Less attempts are needed to puncture a certain tumor with real-time image navigation than without navigation (P{\textless}0.02{\%}). The effectiveness of ultrasonic-based navigation varied with the surgical preconditions.

CONCLUSIONS: The use of a suitable navigation system improves safety and effectiveness in liver surgery for intraoperative localization of key structures such as tumors. However, resecting hepatic tumors with appropriate safety margin demands for further enhancements concerning the proposed methods.},

abstract = {In contrast to the lung and the myocardium, the liver is a relatively homogeneous organ with fewer anatomic constraints on vascular branching. Hence, we hypothesize that the hepatic vasculature could more closely follow optimization of branching geometry than is the case in other organs. The geometrical and fractal properties of the rat hepatic portal vein tree were investigated, with the aid of three-dimensional micro-computed tomography data. Frequency distributions of vessel radii were obtained at three different voxel resolutions and fitted to a theoretical model of dichotomous branching. The model predicted an average junction exponent of 3.09. Hemodynamic model calculations showed that with generation, relative shear stress decreases. Branching angles were found to oscillate between those predicted by two optimality principles of minimum power loss and volume, and of minimum shear stress and surface. The liver shows a variation in branching morphology similar to that of other organs. Therefore, we conclude that anatomic constraints do not have a major perturbing impact.},

abstract = {We developed a highly automated three-dimensionally based method for the segmentation of bone in volumetric computed tomography (CT) datasets. The multistep approach starts with three-dimensional (3-D) region-growing using local adaptive thresholds followed by procedures to correct for remaining boundary discontinuities and a subsequent anatomically oriented boundary adjustment using local values of cortical bone density. We describe the details of our approach and show applications in the proximal femur, the knee, and the skull. The accuracy of the determination of geometrical parameters was analyzed using CT scans of the semi-anthropomorphic European spine phantom. Depending on the settings of the segmentation parameters cortical thickness could be determined with an accuracy corresponding to the side length of 1 to 2.5 voxels. The impact of noise on the segmentation was investigated by artificially adding noise to the CT data. An increase in noise by factors of two and five changed cortical thickness corresponding to the side length of one voxel. Intraoperator and interoperator precision was analyzed by repeated analysis of nine pelvic CT scans. Precision errors were smaller than 1{\%} for trabecular and total volumes and smaller than 2{\%} for cortical thickness. Intraoperator and interoperator precision errors were not significantly different. Our segmentation approach shows: 1) high accuracy and precision and is 2) robust to noise, 3) insensitive to user-defined thresholds, 4) highly automated and fast, and 5) easy to initialize.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The Medical Imaging Interaction Toolkit (MITK) has been available as open-source software for almost 10 years now. In this period the requirements of software systems in the medical image processing domain have become increasingly complex. The aim of this paper is to show how MITK evolved into a software system that is able to cover all steps of a clinical workflow including data retrieval, image analysis, diagnosis, treatment planning, intervention support, and treatment control.

METHODS: MITK provides modularization and extensibility on different levels. In addition to the original toolkit, a module system, micro services for small, system-wide features, a service-oriented architecture based on the Open Services Gateway initiative (OSGi) standard, and an extensible and configurable application framework allow MITK to be used, extended and deployed as needed. A refined software process was implemented to deliver high-quality software, ease the fulfillment of regulatory requirements, and enable teamwork in mixed-competence teams.

RESULTS: MITK has been applied by a worldwide community and integrated into a variety of solutions, either at the toolkit level or as an application framework with custom extensions. The MITK Workbench has been released as a highly extensible and customizable end-user application. Optional support for tool tracking, image-guided therapy, diffusion imaging as well as various external packages (e.g. CTK, DCMTK, OpenCV, SOFA, Python) is available. MITK has also been used in several FDA/CE-certified applications, which demonstrates the high-quality software and rigorous development process.

CONCLUSIONS: MITK provides a versatile platform with a high degree of modularization and interoperability and is well suited to meet the challenging tasks of today's and tomorrow's clinically motivated research.},

A new Euler table is derived to ensure the invariance of the Euler characteristic of the object, during thinning. An octree data structure of 3 × 3 × 3 lattice points is built to examine the local connectivity. The sets of "simple" points found by different researchers are compared with the constructed set. Different definitions of "surface" points including ours are given. By preserving the topological and the geometrical conditions, our algorithm produces desirable skeletons and performs better than others in terms of noise sensitivity and speed. Pre- and postprocessors can be used to remove additional noise spurs. Its use in defect analysis of objects produced by casting and forging is discussed.},

abstract = {This paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge.},

They represent a generalized approach to specific descriptors using a circular-harmonic expansion, a Mellin transform, or moment invariants. The possibility of computing the Fourier-Mellin descriptors by using an optical processor in real time is discussed.},

@article{Bovik1990,
abstract = {A computational approach for analyzing visible textures is described. Textures are modeled as irradiance patterns containing a limited range of spatial frequencies, where mutually distinct textures differ significantly in their dominant characterizing frequencies. By encoding images into multiple narrow spatial frequency and orientation channels, the slowly varying channel envelopes (amplitude and phase) are used to segregate textural regions of different spatial frequency, orientation, or phase characteristics. Thus, an interpretation of image texture as a region code, or carrier of region information, is emphasized. The channel filters used, known as the two-dimensional Gabor functions, are useful for these purposes in several senses: they have tunable orientation and radial frequency bandwidths and tunable center frequencies, and they optimally achieve joint resolution in space and in spatial frequency. By comparing the channel amplitude responses, one can detect boundaries between textures. Locating large variations in the channel phase responses allows discontinuities in the texture phase to be detected. Examples are given of both types of texture processing using a variety of real and synthetic textures.},

abstract = {The representation of geometric objects based on volumetric data structures has advantages in many geometry processing applications that require, e.g., fast surface interrogation or boolean operations such as intersection and union. However, surface based algorithms like shape optimization (fairing) or freeform modeling often need a topological manifold representation where neighborhood information within the surface is explicitly available. Consequently, it is necessary to find effective conversion algorithms to generate explicit surface descriptions for the geometry which is implicitly defined by a volumetric data set. Since volume data is usually sampled on a regular grid with a given step width, we often observe severe alias artifacts at sharp features on the extracted surfaces. In this paper we present a new technique for surface extraction that performs feature sensitive sampling and thus reduces these alias effects while keeping the simple algorithmic structure of the standard Marching Cubes algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the new technique with a number of application examples ranging from CSG modeling and simulation to surface reconstruction and remeshing of polygonal models.},

abstract = {This paper describes the rapid evolution of modern liver surgery, starting in the middle of the twentieth century. Claude Couinaud studied and described the segmental anatomy of the liver, Thomas Starzl performed the first liver transplantations, and Henri Bismuth introduced the concept of anatomical resections. Hepatic surgery has developed significantly since those early days. To date, innovative techniques are applied, using cutting-edge technologies: Intraoperative ultrasound, techniques of vascular exclusion of the liver, new devices for performing homeostasis and dissection, laparoscopy for resections, and new drugs that allow the resection of previously unresectable tumors. The next stage in liver surgery will probably be the implementation of a multidisciplinary holistic approach to the liver-diseased patient that will ensure the best and most efficient treatments in the future.},

abstract = {The proposed fakir method for estimating surface area is based on counting the intersections between the surface lying within a thick slice, and an isotropic spatial grid consisting of a combination of linear probes called fakir probes. An unbiased procedure using a directly randomized spatial grid rather than sections with randomized directions is presented. The method is applicable if perfectly registered serial sections of the surface are available in a thick slice while the direction of the slice can be arbitrary. The efficiency of the fakir method using different arrangements of orthogonal triplets of fakir probes is evaluated and it is shown that mutually shifted probes are superior to non-shifted ones. The application software for interactive counting of intersections between computer-generated fakir probes and the surface within the stack of digitized images is described and demonstrated by two examples: estimation of the surface area of individual tobacco cell chains using a confocal microscope, and estimation of the total area of exposed surface of mesophyll cells in a barley leaf using a wide-field transmission microscope.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Serum tumor markers and computed tomography (CT) are the most widely accepted monitoring tools for the follow-up patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Positron emission tomography (PET) with 18[F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is a promising modality for the evaluation of recurrent CRC. The purpose of this study was to (1) investigate the sensitivity and specificity of serum tumor marker assay, CT and FDG PET-CT, (2) determine the correlation of these markers with FDG PET-CT quantitative indices such as maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) in patients suspected to have recurrent CRC. PATIENTS: FDG PET-CT imaging was performed in 212 patients with possible CRC recurrence. A retrospective study was performed on patients with (1) a history of CRC with complete remission after treatment, (2) pathology of adenocarcinoma and (3) increase in cancer antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) and/or carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) or suspicious radiological evaluation during follow-up after complete remission. METHODS: All patients underwent integrated FDG PET-CT scan. Serum tumor markers were obtained within 3 months of PET-CT. All enrolled cases showed increase in a tumor marker over the reference value on at least two serial measurements or abnormal CT scan before PET-CT was performed. Results were compared with histopathological findings or clinical follow-up. RESULTS: Following exclusion of 57 patients with missing data or lost to follow-up, 155 patients (87 men, mean age: 61 years) remained for final analysis. Serum CEA and CA 19-9 had a sensitivity of 74 and 35 {\%} and specificity of 86 and 83 {\%} for the detection recurrent CRC, respectively. The sensitivities of CT and FDG PET-CT were 79 and 92 {\%} and specificities were 45 and 100 {\%}, respectively. At an adaptive threshold of 42 {\%}, the median SUVmax, SUVmean, MTV and TLG of these lesions were 8.8, 5.2, 11.3 cm[Formula: see text] and 55.4, respectively. All FDG PET-CT quantitative parameters correlated positively with serum CEA levels, and the correlation coefficients were 0.45, 0.44 and 0.49 for SUVmax, MTV and TLG [Formula: see text]. CONCLUSION: PET-CT scan, CEA and CA-19-9 results were correlated. However, both tumor markers had poor sensitivity to detect metastatic disease. PET-CT is more accurate than CT in detecting recurrent CRC in this study. Majority of the recurrences were in the liver and the sensitivity is affected by tumor histology. The correlation between semiquantitative FDG PET parameters and serum tumor marker levels is moderate.},

Normalized Cuts (NCut) is a spectral graph theoretic method that readily admits combinations of different features for image segmentation. The computational demand imposed by NCut has been successfully alleviated with the Nystr{\"{o}}m approximation method for applications different than medical imaging. In this paper we discuss the application of NCut with the Nystr{\"{o}}m approximation method to segment vertebral bodies from sagittal T1-weighted magnetic resonance images of the spine. The magnetic resonance images were preprocessed by the anisotropic diffusion algorithm, and three-dimensional local histograms of brightness was chosen as the segmentation feature.

abstract = {PURPOSE: Statistical shape models (SSMs) represent morphological variations of a specific object. When there are large shape variations, the shape parameters constitute a large space that may include incorrect parameters. The human liver is a non-rigid organ subject to large deformations due to external forces or body position changes during scanning procedures. We developed and tested a population-based model to represent the shape of liver.

METHODS: Upper abdominal CT-scan input images are represented by a conventional shape model. The shape parameters of individual livers extracted from the CT scans are employed to classify them into different populations. Corresponding to each population, an SSM model is built. The liver surface parameter space is divided into several subspaces which are more compact than the original space. The proposed model was tested using 29 CT-scan liver image data sets. The method was evaluated by model compactness, reconstruction error, generality and specificity measures.

RESULTS: The proposed model is implemented and tested using CT scans that included liver shapes with large shape variations. The method was compared with conventional and recently developed shape modeling methods. The accuracy of the proposed model was nearly twice that achieved with the conventional model. The proposed population-based model was more general compared with the conventional model. The mean reconstruction error of the proposed model was 0.029 mm while that of the conventional model was 0.052 mm.

CONCLUSION: A population-based model to represent the shape of liver was developed and tested with favorable results. Using this approach, the liver shapes from CT scans were modeled by a more compact, more general, and more accurate model.},

abstract = {Liver surgery is a field in which computer-based operation planning has an enormous impact on the selection of therapeutic strategy. Based on pre-operative analysis of image data, liver operation planning provides a individual impression of tumor location, the exact structure of the vascular system and an identification of liver segments and sub-segments. In this paper we present an operation planning system that is based on an object-oriented framework. This framework offers extensive automation of the integration process for software modules developed for medical software systems. The operation planning system can calculate the operation proposal results using two different approaches. The first method is based on the Couinaud's classification system, which uses the main stems of the portal and venous trees. The second approach is a portal vein based method. These two approaches were compared using 23 liver CT scans. The volumetric data for individual segments demonstrates differences between the two segment classification methods.},

abstract = {A texture segmentation algorithm inspired by the multichannel filtering theory for visual information processing in the early stages of the human visual system is presented. The channels are characterized by a bank of Gabor filters that nearly uniformly covers the spatial-frequency domain. A systematic filter selection scheme based on reconstruction of the input image from the filtered images is proposed. Texture features are obtained by subjecting each (selected) filtered image to a nonlinear transformation and computing a measure of energy in a window around each pixel. An unsupervised square-error clustering algorithm is then used to integrate the feature images and produce a segmentation. A simple procedure to incorporate spatial adjacency information in the clustering process is proposed. Experiments on images with natural textures as well as artificial textures with identical second and third-order statistics are reported. The algorithm appears to perform as predicted by preattentive texture discrimination by a human},

abstract = {The pig is a large animal model that is often used in experimental medicine. The aim of this study was to assess, in normal pig livers, sexual dimorphism in the normal fraction of hepatic interlobular and intralobular connective tissue (CT) in six hepatic lobes and in three macroscopical regions of interest (ROIs) with different positions relative to the liver vasculature. Using stereological point grids, the fractions of CT were quantified in histological sections stained with aniline blue and nuclear fast red. Samples (415 tissue blocks) were collected from healthy piglets, representing paracaval, paraportal and peripheral ROIs. There was considerable variability in the CT fraction at all sampling levels. In males the mean fraction of interlobular CT was 4.7 ± 2.4{\%} (mean ± SD) and ranged from 0{\%} to 11.4{\%}. In females the mean fraction of the interlobular CT was 3.6 ± 2.2{\%} and ranged from 0{\%} to 12.3{\%}. The mean fraction of intralobular (perisinusoidal summed with pericentral) CT was {\textless}0.2{\%} in both sexes. The interlobular CT represented {\textgreater}99.8{\%} of the total hepatic CT and the fractions were highly correlated (Spearman r = 0.998, P {\textless}0.05). The smallest CT fraction was observed in the left medial lobe and in the paracaval ROI and the largest CT fraction was detected in the quadrate lobe and in the peripheral ROI. For planning experiments involving the histological quantification of liver fibrosis and requiring comparison between the liver lobes, these data facilitate the power analysis for sample size needed to detect the expected relative increase or decrease in the fraction of CT.},

abstract = {The architecture of the vascular network is crucial because almost every disease alters the morphology of the blood vessel. Although existing imaging technique can provide vessel images, microvessels will not be discerned without the use of contrast agents. Furthermore, conventional imaging technique can only provide the outline of the vessels due to the restriction of spatial resolution. In this study, a novel imaging technique, diffraction enhanced imaging (DEI), is applied to the observation of microvessels in mouse hepatic fibrosis samples. With high spatial resolution and contrast of biological soft tissues, DEI is a non-invasive synchrotron-based imaging technique and does not require contrast agents. Particularly, this article highlights the exploration of the objects inside microvessels. A segment of blood vessel, which is obstructed by a blood clot, is under quantitative assessment and the result provides a precise description of vessel stenosis. Additionally, as one of the application of the diffraction enhanced imaging, blood stream simulation is carried out on the three-dimensional model of the vessel. It proves that this imaging technique has great value in evaluating hemodynamics and histopathology of microvascular diseases.},

abstract = {In this paper we describe a new technique for general purpose interactive segmentation of N-dimensional images. The user marks certain pixels as {\&}ldquo;object{\&}rdquo; or {\&}ldquo;background{\&}rdquo; to provide hard constraints for segmentation. Additional soft constraints incorporate both boundary and region information. Graph cuts are used to find the globally optimal segmentation of the N-dimensional image. The obtained solution gives the best balance of boundary and region properties among all segmentations satisfying the constraints. The topology of our segmentation is unrestricted and both {\&}ldquo;object{\&}rdquo; and {\&}ldquo;background{\&}rdquo; segments may consist of several isolated parts. Some experimental results are presented in the context of photo/video editing and medical image segmentation. We also demonstrate an interesting Gestalt example. A fast implementation of our segmentation method is possible via a new max-flow algorithm},

abstract = {Percolation theory provides a tool for linking microstructure and macroscopic material properties. In this paper, percolation theory is applied to the analysis of microtomographic images for the purpose of deriving scaling laws for upscaling of properties. We have tested the acquisition of quantities such as percolation threshold, crossover length, fractal dimension, and critical exponent of correlation length from microtomography. By inflating or deflating the target phase and percolation analysis, we can get a critical model and an estimation of the percolation threshold. The crossover length is determined from the critical model by numerical simulation. The fractal dimension can be obtained either from the critical model or from the relative size distribution of clusters. Local probabilities of percolation are used to extract the critical exponent of the correlation length. For near-isotropic samples such as sandstone and bread, the approach works very well. For strongly anisotropic samples, such as highly deformed rock (mylonite) and a tree branch, the percolation threshold and fractal dimension can be assessed with accuracy. However, the uncertainty of the correlation length makes it difficult to accurately extract its critical exponents. Therefore, this aspect of percolation theory cannot be reliably used for upscaling properties of strongly anisotropic media. Other methods of upscaling have to be used for such media.},

abstract = {Chronic hepatic injury results in liver fibrosis with eventual progression to irreversible cirrhosis. Liver fibrogenesis involves the activation of the quiescent hepatic stellate cell into an activated myofibroblast that is characterized by alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) expression and the production of collagens (types I and III). In the present study, rats were randomly divided into three groups: (i) control group, where rats were only treated with a vehicle; (ii) fibrosis group, where rats were treated with carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) to induce liver fibrosis; and (iii) silymarin group, where rats were protected with silymarin during CCl(4) treatment. Rats were sacrificed and sections of liver tissue were counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome. Other sections were immunostained using collagens and alpha-SMA primary antibodies. Fibrosis was confirmed using serum marker measurements. Microscopic images of the stained sections were acquired and digitized. The Biomarker Index of Fibrosis (BIF) was calculated from the images by quantifying the percentage of stained fibers. Statistical methods of texture analysis (TA), namely co-occurrence and run-length matrices, were applied on the digital images followed by classification using agglomerative hierarchical clustering and linear discriminant analysis with cross validation. TA applied on different biomarkers was successful in discriminating between the groups, showing 100{\%} sensitivity and specificity for classification between the control and fibrosis groups using any biomarker. Some classification attempts showed dependence on the biomarker used, especially for classification between the silymarin and fibrosis groups, which showed optimal results using Masson's trichrome. TA results were consistent with both BIF and serum marker measurements.},

abstract = {A method to extract myocardial coronary permeabilities appropriate to parameterise a continuum porous perfusion model using the underlying anatomical vascular network is developed. Canine and porcine whole-heart discrete arterial models were extracted from high-resolution cryomicrotome vessel image stacks. Five parameterisation methods were considered that are primarily distinguished by the level of anatomical data used in the definition of the permeability and pressure-coupling fields. Continuum multi-compartment porous perfusion model pressure results derived using these parameterisation methods were compared quantitatively via a root-mean-square metric to the Poiseuille pressure solved on the discrete arterial vasculature. The use of anatomical detail to parameterise the porous medium significantly improved the continuum pressure results. The majority of this improvement was attributed to the use of anatomically-derived pressure-coupling fields. It was found that the best results were most reliably obtained by using porosity-scaled isotropic permeabilities and anatomically-derived pressure-coupling fields. This paper presents the first continuum perfusion model where all parameters were derived from the underlying anatomical vascular network.},

abstract = {Experimental data and advanced imaging techniques are increasingly enabling the extraction of detailed vascular anatomy from biological tissues. Incorporation of anatomical data within perfusion models is non-trivial, due to heterogeneous vessel density and disparate radii scales. Furthermore, previous idealised networks have assumed a spatially repeating motif or periodic canonical cell, thereby allowing for a flow solution via homogenisation. However, such periodicity is not observed throughout anatomical networks. In this study, we apply various spatial averaging methods to discrete vascular geometries in order to parameterise a continuum model of perfusion. Specifically, a multi-compartment Darcy model was used to provide vascular scale separation for the fluid flow. Permeability tensor fields were derived from both synthetic and anatomically realistic networks using (1) porosity-scaled isotropic, (2) Huyghe and Van Campen, and (3) projected-PCA methods. The Darcy pressure fields were compared via a root-mean-square error metric to an averaged Poiseuille pressure solution over the same domain. The method of Huyghe and Van Campen performed better than the other two methods in all simulations, even for relatively coarse networks. Furthermore, inter-compartment volumetric flux fields, determined using the spatially averaged discrete flux per unit pressure difference, were shown to be accurate across a range of pressure boundary conditions. This work justifies the application of continuum flow models to characterise perfusion resulting from flow in an underlying vascular network.},

abstract = {SimpleITK is a new interface to the Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK) designed to facilitate rapid prototyping, education and scientific activities via high level programming languages. ITK is a templated C++ library of image processing algorithms and frameworks for biomedical and other applications, and it was designed to be generic, flexible and extensible. Initially, ITK provided a direct wrapping interface to languages such as Python and Tcl through the WrapITK system. Unlike WrapITK, which exposed ITK's complex templated interface, SimpleITK was designed to provide an easy to use and simplified interface to ITK's algorithms. It includes procedural methods, hides ITK's demand driven pipeline, and provides a template-less layer. Also SimpleITK provides practical conveniences such as binary distribution packages and overloaded operators. Our user-friendly design goals dictated a departure from the direct interface wrapping approach of WrapITK, toward a new facade class structure that only exposes the required functionality, hiding ITK's extensive template use. Internally SimpleITK utilizes a manual description of each filter with code-generation and advanced C++ meta-programming to provide the higher-level interface, bringing the capabilities of ITK to a wider audience.

The basic LBP encodes 256 simple feature detectors in a single 3x3 operator. This paper shows that a properly selected subset of patterns encoded in LBP forms an efficient and robust texture description which can achieve better classification rates in comparison with the whole LBP histogram.

abstract = {The problem of efficient, interactive foreground/background segmentation in still images is of great practical importance in image editing. Classical image segmentation tools use either texture (colour) information, e.g. Magic Wand, or edge (contrast) information, e.g. Intelligent Scissors. Recently, an approach based on optimization by graph-cut has been developed which successfully combines both types of information. In this paper we extend the graph-cut approach in three respects. First, we have developed a more powerful, iterative version of the optimisation. Secondly, the power of the iterative algorithm is used to simplify substantially the user interaction needed for a given quality of result. Thirdly, a robust algorithm for "border matting" has been developed to estimate simultaneously the alpha-matte around an object boundary and the colours of foreground pixels. We show that for moderately difficult examples the proposed method outperforms competitive tools.},

abstract = {Intense interest in applying convolutional neural net-works (CNNs) in biomedical image analysis is wide spread, but its success is impeded by the lack of large annotated datasets in biomedical imaging. Annotating biomedical im-ages is not only tedious and time consuming, but also de-manding of costly, specialty-oriented knowledge and skill-s, which are not easily accessible. To dramatically reduce annotation cost, this paper presents a novel method called AIFT (active, incremental fine-tuning) to naturally integrate active learning and transfer learning into a single frame-work. AIFT starts directly with a pre-trained CNN to seek " worthy " samples from the unannotated for annotation, and the (fine-tuned) CNN is further fine-tuned continuously by incorporating newly annotated samples in each iteration to enhance the CNN's performance incrementally. We have evaluated our method in three different biomedical imaging applications, demonstrating that the cost of annotation can be cut by at least half. This performance is attributed to the several advantages derived from the advanced active and incremental capability of our AIFT method.},

abstract = {The definition and extraction of objects and their boundaries within an image are essential in many imaging applications. Classically, two approaches are followed. The first considers the image as a sample of a continuous scalar field: boundaries are implicit surfaces in this field; they are often called iso-surfaces. The second considers the image as a digital space with adjacency relations and classifies elements of this space as inside or outside: boundaries are pairs composed of one inside element and one outside element; they are called digital boundaries. In this paper, we show that these two approaches are closely related. This statement holds for arbitrary dimensions. To do so, we propose a local method to construct a continuous analog of a digital boundary. The continuous analog is designed to satisfy properties in the Euclidean space that are similar to the properties of its counterpart in the digital space (e.g., connectedness, closeness, separation). It appears that this continuous analog is indeed a piecewise linear approximation of an iso-(hyper)surface (i.e., a triangulated iso-surface in the three-dimensional case). Furthermore, we derive significant digital boundary properties from its continuous analog using the Jordan-Brouwer separation theorem: new Jordan pairs, new adjacencies between boundary elements, new Jordan triples. We conclude this paper by illustrating the 3D case more precisely. In particular, we show that a digital boundary can be transformed directly into a triangulated iso-surface. The implementation of this transformation and its efficiency are discussed with a comparison with the classical marching-cubes algorithm.},

The results are visualized in 3D, thus allowing the surgeon to choose the optimal strategy for each patient. The software was tested in over 50 cases by our clinical partners and our institution.

abstract = {This paper presents a comparison study between 10 automatic and six interactive methods for liver segmentation from contrast-enhanced CT images. It is based on results from the "MICCAI 2007 Grand Challenge" workshop, where 16 teams evaluated their algorithms on a common database. A collection of 20 clinical images with reference segmentations was provided to train and tune algorithms in advance. Participants were also allowed to use additional proprietary training data for that purpose. All teams then had to apply their methods to 10 test datasets and submit the obtained results. Employed algorithms include statistical shape models, atlas registration, level-sets, graph-cuts and rule-based systems. All results were compared to reference segmentations five error measures that highlight different aspects of segmentation accuracy. All measures were combined according to a specific scoring system relating the obtained values to human expert variability. In general, interactive methods reached higher average scores than automatic approaches and featured a better consistency of segmentation quality. However, the best automatic methods (mainly based on statistical shape models with some additional free deformation) could compete well on the majority of test images. The study provides an insight in performance of different segmentation approaches under real-world conditions and highlights achievements and limitations of current image analysis techniques.},

abstract = {We introduce new results connecting differential and morphological operators that provide a formal and theoretically grounded approach for stable and fast contour evolution. Contour evolution algorithms have been extensively used for boundary detection and tracking in computer vision. The standard solution based on partial differential equations and level-sets requires the use of numerical methods of integration that are costly computationally and may have stability issues. We present a morphological approach to contour evolution based on a new curvature morphological operator valid for surfaces of any dimension. We approximate the numerical solution of the curve evolution PDE by the successive application of a set of morphological operators defined on a binary level-set and with equivalent infinitesimal behavior. These operators are very fast, do not suffer numerical stability issues, and do not degrade the level set function, so there is no need to reinitialize it. Moreover, their implementation is much easier since they do not require the use of sophisticated numerical algorithms. We validate the approach providing a morphological implementation of the geodesic active contours, the active contours without borders, and turbopixels. In the experiments conducted, the morphological implementations converge to solutions equivalent to those achieved by traditional numerical solutions, but with significant gains in simplicity, speed, and stability.},

abstract = {Many methods for object recognition, segmentation, etc., rely on a tessellation of an image into “superpixels”. A superpixel is an image patch which is better aligned with intensity edges than a rect- angular patch. Superpixels can be extracted with any segmentation al- gorithm, however, most of them produce highly irregular superpixels, with widely varying sizes and shapes. A more regular space tessellation may be desired. We formulate the superpixel partitioning problem in an energy minimization framework, and optimize with graph cuts. Our energy function explicitly encourages regular superpixels. We explore variations of the basic energy, which allow a trade-off between a less reg- ular tessellation but more accurate boundaries or better efficiency. Our advantage over previous work is computational efficiency, principled opti- mization, and applicability to 3D “supervoxel” segmentation.We achieve high boundary recall on images and spatial coherence on video. We also show that compact superpixels improve accuracy on a simple application of salient object segmentation.},

@phdthesis{tylecek2015,
abstract = {This thesis deals with application of symmetry principles to computer vision problems of object detection in images. The focus is put on the ways how our prior knowledge on translation, reflection and rotation symmetries can be encoded in probabilistic models. Conceptually the position of our object-centered approach lies between general symmetry detection and strongly informed procedural modeling. In particular we present two methods for parsing of facade images, where translation symmetry manifests in the structure of architectural elements like windows, doors and cornices. In both cases the structural model is based on local interactions between objects and the symmetry is represented in the spirit of Gestaltian grouping principles of proximity, similarity and continuity. The initial method Weak Structure Model uses efficient random sampling to infer the most probable configuration of windows. Experimental results suggest that a simple data model accompanied with appropriate symmetry prior can outperform other methods with more specific window classifiers. The next approach called Spatial Pattern Templates aims to learn the important relations of the facade structure beforehand rather than inferring it at inference time like in the previous case. This process is facilitated by conditional random field framework, where powerful training methods are available. We have also found that the available datasets cannot provide a number of samples sufficient for such training. We have resolved this obstacle by assembly of a rich and large CMP Facade Database, which is now available to other researchers. The last method explores the remaining reflection and rotation symmetries. At this time the Bayesian inference is used to handle a hierarchical model extending from the low-level geometry of reflection symmetry to dihedral symmetry groups. Objectness and compactness priors are included to reduce ambiguity in the detection. The increased complexity of the model is compensated by utilization of an advanced inference method, which allows to rigorously reason about number of detected components by means of model selection. In result we show this approach improves performance on standard datasets, particularly in the case when multiple objects are present.},

abstract = {Vascular diseases are among the most important public health problems in developed countries. Given the size and complexity of modern angiographic acquisitions, segmentation is a key step toward the accurate visualization, diagnosis and quantification of vascular pathologies. Despite the tremendous amount of past and on-going dedicated research, vascular segmentation remains a challenging task. In this paper, we review state-of-the-art literature on vascular segmentation, with a particular focus on 3D contrast-enhanced imaging modalities (MRA and CTA). We structure our analysis along three axes: models, features and extraction schemes. We first detail model-based assumptions on the vessel appearance and geometry which can embedded in a segmentation approach. We then review the image features that can be extracted to evaluate these models. Finally, we discuss how existing extraction schemes combine model and feature information to perform the segmentation task. Each component (model, feature and extraction scheme) plays a crucial role toward the efficient, robust and accurate segmentation of vessels of interest. Along each axis of study, we discuss the theoretical and practical properties of recent approaches and highlight the most advanced and promising ones.},

Computer tomography (CT) is one of the most useful approaches for investigating the arterial system and its pathologies. There are three ways for segmenting the vessels from the CT image --- manually, fully automatically and with a user interaction. We considered the (semi)automatic approaches, because the manual way is too time-consuming and human-dependent. We used a combination of three segmentation techniques: thresholding, edge detection and region growing. Results of this method were consulted then with a medicine expert. None of these techniques can be used separately, but a combination of them brought very good results, which can be used in medicine.},

abstract = {The high spatial resolution of micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) is ideal for 3D imaging of coronary arteries in intact mouse heart specimens. Previously, micro-CT of mouse heart specimens utilized intravascular contrast agents that hardened within the vessel lumen and allowed a vascular cast to be made. However, for mouse coronary artery disease models, it is highly desirable to image coronary artery walls and highlight plaques. For this purpose, we describe an ex vivo contrast-enhanced micro-CT imaging technique based on tissue staining with osmium tetroxide (OsO(4) ) solution. As a tissue-staining contrast agent, OsO(4) is retained in the vessel wall and surrounding tissue during the fixation process and cleared from the vessel lumens. Its high X-ray attenuation makes the artery wall visible in CT. Additionally, since OsO(4) preferentially binds to lipids, it highlights lipid deposition in the artery wall. We performed micro-CT of heart specimens of 5- to 25-week-old C57BL/6 wild-type mice and 5- to 13-week-old apolipoprotein E knockout (apoE(-/-) ) mice at 10 $\mu$m resolution. The results show that walls of coronary arteries as small as 45 $\mu$m in diameter are visible using a table-top micro-CT scanner. Similar image clarity was achieved with 1/2000th the scan time using a synchrotron CT scanner. In 13-week-old apoE mice, lipid-rich plaques are visible in the aorta. Our study shows that the combination of OsO(4) and micro-CT permits the visualization of the coronary artery wall in intact mouse hearts.},

abstract = {Quantitative analysis of blood perfusion has been performed with a hierarchical mixture model of blood perfused biological tissue, for low Reynolds steady state Poiseuillian flow through two-dimensional, computer generated, rigid, arterial vascular trees. The mixture model describes blood flow through the vasculature by spatial and hierarchical flow components, both related to the blood pressure gradient via an extended Darcy equation. The Darcy-permeability tensor is derived from the geometry of the vascular tree, the fluid viscosity, and the vascular hierarchy which is quantified by a dimensionless parameter xo. Finite element results of fluid pressure and flow on certain levels of the hierarchy are compared to correspondingly volume averaged pressures and flows calculated by hydraulic network analysis. The correspondence between the finite element results and the network results strongly depends on the quantification of the hierarchy, which should be closely related to the hierarchical fluid pressure. Two methods for hierarchical quantification have been used, one of which is based on the network fluid pressure and the other on the segment diameters. With the first method a good correlation between x0 and fluid pressure, and consequently a good correspondence between finite element and network results, are found. The second method yields a poor correlation between xo and fluid pressure. However, still satisfying correspondence between finite element and network results is found.},

abstract = {Background: Pigs are frequently used as animal models in experimental medicine. To identify processes of vascular development or regression, vascular elements must be recognised and quantified in a three-dimensional (3D) arrangement. Vascular corrosion casts enable the creation of 3D replicas of vascular trees. The aim of our study was to identify suitable casting media and optimise the protocol for porcine liver vascular corrosion casting.Materials and methods: Mercox II{\textregistered} (Ladd Research, Williston, Vermont, USA) and Biodur E20{\textregistered} Plus (Biodur Products, Heidelberg, Germany) were tested in 4 porcine livers. The resins (volume approximately 700 mL) were injected via the portal vein. Corrosion casts were examined by macro-computed tomography, micro-computed tomography and scanning electron microscopy.Results: For hepatectomies, the operating protocol was optimised to avoid gas or blood clot embolisation. We present a protocol for porcine liver vascular bed casting based on corrosion specimens prepared using Biodur E20{\textregistered} epoxy resin.Conclusions: Only Biodur E20{\textregistered}Plus appeared to be suitable for high-volume vascular corrosion casting due to its optimal permeability, sufficient processing time and minimum fragility. Biodur E20{\textregistered} Plus is slightly elastic, radio-opaque and alcohol-resistant. These properties make this acrylic resin suitable for not only vascular research but also teaching purposes.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {We have developed a new hierarchical 3D technique to segment the vertebral bodies in order to measure bone mineral density (BMD) with high trueness and precision in volumetric CT datasets. The hierarchical approach starts with a coarse separation of the individual vertebrae, applies a variety of techniques to segment the vertebral bodies with increasing detail and ends with the definition of an anatomic coordinate system for each vertebral body, relative to which up to 41 trabecular and cortical volumes of interest are positioned. In a pre-segmentation step constraints consisting of Boolean combinations of simple geometric shapes are determined that enclose each individual vertebral body. Bound by these constraints viscous deformable models are used to segment the main shape of the vertebral bodies. Volume growing and morphological operations then capture the fine details of the bone-soft tissue interface. In the volumes of interest bone mineral density and content are determined. In addition, in the segmented vertebral bodies geometric parameters such as volume or the length of the main axes of inertia can be measured. Intra- and inter-operator precision errors of the segmentation procedure were analyzed using existing clinical patient datasets. Results for segmented volume, BMD, and coordinate system position were below 2.0{\%}, 0.6{\%}, and 0.7{\%}, respectively. Trueness was analyzed using phantom scans. The bias of the segmented volume was below 4{\%}; for BMD it was below 1.5{\%}. The long-term goal of this work is improved fracture prediction and patient monitoring in the field of osteoporosis. A true 3D segmentation also enables an accurate measurement of geometrical parameters that may augment the clinical value of a pure BMD analysis.},

@article{Vivanti2017,
abstract = {PURPOSE: Radiological longitudinal follow-up of liver tumors in CT scans is the standard of care for disease progression assessment and for liver tumor therapy. Finding new tumors in the follow-up scan is essential to determine malignancy, to evaluate the total tumor burden, and to determine treatment efficacy. Since new tumors are typically small, they may be missed by examining radiologists. METHODS: We describe a new method for the automatic detection and segmentation of new tumors in longitudinal liver CT studies and for liver tumors burden quantification. Its inputs are the baseline and follow-up CT scans, the baseline tumors delineation, and a tumor appearance prior model. Its outputs are the new tumors segmentations in the follow-up scan, the tumor burden quantification in both scans, and the tumor burden change. Our method is the first comprehensive method that is explicitly designed to find new liver tumors. It integrates information from the scans, the baseline known tumors delineations, and a tumor appearance prior model in the form of a global convolutional neural network classifier. Unlike other deep learning-based methods, it does not require large tagged training sets. RESULTS: Our experimental results on 246 tumors, of which 97 were new tumors, from 37 longitudinal liver CT studies with radiologist approved ground-truth segmentations, yields a true positive new tumors detection rate of 86 versus 72{\%} with stand-alone detection, and a tumor burden volume overlap error of 16{\%}. CONCLUSIONS: New tumors detection and tumor burden volumetry are important for diagnosis and treatment. Our new method enables a simplified radiologist-friendly workflow that is potentially more accurate and reliable than the existing one by automatically and accurately following known tumors and detecting new tumors in the follow-up scan.},

abstract = {A method to extract myocardial coronary permeabilities appropriate to parameterise a continuum porous perfusion model using the underlying anatomical vascular network is developed. Canine and porcine whole-heart discrete arterial models were extracted from high-resolution cryomicrotome vessel image stacks. Five parameterisation methods were considered that are primarily distinguished by the level of anatomical data used in the definition of the permeability and pressure-coupling fields. Continuum multi-compartment porous perfusion model pressure results derived using these parameterisation methods were compared quantitatively via a root-mean-square metric to the Poiseuille pressure solved on the discrete arterial vasculature. The use of anatomical detail to parameterise the porous medium significantly improved the continuum pressure results. The majority of this improvement was attributed to the use of anatomically-derived pressure-coupling fields. It was found that the best results were most reliably obtained by using porosity-scaled isotropic permeabilities and anatomically-derived pressure-coupling fields. This paper presents the first continuum perfusion model where all parameters were derived from the underlying anatomical vascular network.},

This technique relies on the presence of flow to create detailed vasculature maps. Employing this contrast mechanism is not possible using conventional imaging methods. Additionally, a freeware algorithm for computing functional vascular density (FVD) from images acquired using long-exposure LSI is also described to facilitate ease in adopting this method. We demonstrate that together these tools can be used to compute FVD nearly twelve times faster than manual computation, yet with comparable accuracy.},

Image registration is the process of overlaying images (two or more) of the same scene taken at different times, from different viewpoints, and/or by different sensors. The registration geometrically align two images (the reference and sensed images). The reviewed approaches are classified according to their nature (area-based and feature-based) and according to four basic steps of image registration procedure: feature detection, feature matching, mapping function design, and image transformation and resampling. Main contributions, advantages, and drawbacks of the methods are mentioned in the paper. Problematic issues of image registration and outlook for the future research are discussed too.

abstract = {The increasing interest in Support Vector Machines (SVMs) over the past 15 years is described. Methods are illustrated using simulated case studies, and 4 experimental case studies, namely mass spectrometry for studying pollution, near infrared analysis of food, thermal analysis of polymers and UV/visible spectroscopy of polyaromatic hydrocarbons. The basis of SVMs as two-class classifiers is shown with extensive visualisation, including learning machines, kernels and penalty functions. The influence of the penalty error and radial basis function radius on the model is illustrated. Multiclass implementations including one vs. all, one vs. one, fuzzy rules and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) trees are described. One-class Support Vector Domain Description (SVDD) is described and contrasted to conventional two- or multi-class classifiers. The use of Support Vector Regression (SVR) is illustrated including its application to multivariate calibration, and why it is useful when there are outliers and non-linearities.},

@article{Maes1997,
abstract = {A new approach to the problem of multimodality medical image registration is proposed, using a basic concept from information theory, mutual information (MI), or relative entropy, as a new matching criterion. The method presented in this paper applies MI to measure the statistical dependence or information redundancy between the image intensities of corresponding voxels in both images, which is assumed to be maximal if the images are geometrically aligned. Maximization of MI is a very general and powerful criterion, because no assumptions are made regarding the nature of this dependence and no limiting constraints are imposed on the image content of the modalities involved. The accuracy of the MI criterion is validated for rigid body registration of computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and photon emission tomography (PET) images by comparison with the stereotactic registration solution, while robustness is evaluated with respect to implementation issues, such as interpolation and optimization, and image content, including partial overlap and image degradation. Our results demonstrate that subvoxel accuracy with respect to the stereotactic reference solution can be achieved completely automatically and without any prior segmentation, feature extraction, or other preprocessing steps which makes this method very well suited for clinical applications.},

By topologically consistent we mean that the topology of the piecewise triangular surface matches that of the surfacef(x, y, z)=t, i.e., the interpolantf determines both the geometry and the topology of the piecewise triangular surface. In this paper we provide an efficient algorithm for the case in whichf is the piecewise trilinear interpolant; for this case existing methods fail to satisfy all three of the above conditions simultaneously.},

abstract = {Accurate preoperative assessment of the hepatic vascular and biliary anatomy is essential to ensure safe and successful hepatic surgery. Such surgical procedures range from the more complex, like tumor resection and partial hepatectomy for living donor liver transplantation, to others performed more routinely, like laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Modern noninvasive diagnostic imaging techniques, such as multidetector computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging performed with liver-specific contrast agents with biliary excretion, have replaced conventional angiography and endoscopic cholangiography for evaluation of the hepatic vascular and biliary anatomy. These techniques help determine the best hepatectomy plane and help identify patients in whom additional surgical steps will be required. Preoperative knowledge of hepatic vascular and biliary anatomic variants is mandatory for surgical planning and to help reduce postoperative complications. Multidetector CT and MR imaging, with the added value of image postprocessing, allow accurate identification of areas at risk for venous congestion or devascularization. This information may influence surgical planning with regard to the extent of hepatic resection or the need for vascular reconstruction.},

abstract = {Image segmentation is often described as partitioning an image into a finite number of semantically non-overlapping regions. In medical applications, it is a fundamental pro- cess in most systems that support medical diagnosis, surgical planning and treatments. Generally, this process is done manually by clinicians, which may be time-consuming and tedious. To alleviate the problem, a number of interactive segmentation methods have been proposed in the literature. These techniques take advantage of automatic segmentation and allow users to intervene the segmentation process by incorporating prior-knowledge, validating results and correcting errors, thus potentially lead to accu- rate segmentation results. In this paper, we present an overview on interactive segmen- tation techniques for medical images. 1},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the use of open source software (OSS) to process DICOM images. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We selected 23 programs for Windows and 20 programs for Mac from 150 possible OSS programs including DICOM viewers and various tools (converters, DICOM header editors, etc.). The programs selected all meet the basic requirements such as free availability, stand-alone application, presence of graphical user interface, ease of installation and advanced features beyond simple display monitor. Capabilities of data import, data export, metadata, 2D viewer, 3D viewer, support platform and usability of each selected program were evaluated on a scale ranging from 1 to 10 points. RESULTS: Twelve programs received a score higher than or equal to eight. Among them, five obtained a score of 9: 3D Slicer, MedINRIA, MITK 3M3, VolView, VR Render; while OsiriX received 10. CONCLUSIONS: OsiriX appears to be the only program able to perform all the operations taken into consideration, similar to a workstation equipped with proprietary software, allowing the analysis and interpretation of images in a simple and intuitive way. OsiriX is a DICOM PACS workstation for medical imaging and software for image processing for medical research, functional imaging, 3D imaging, confocal microscopy and molecular imaging. This application is also a good tool for teaching activities because it facilitates the attainment of learning objectives among students and other specialists.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {We propose a workflow to provide detailed characterisation of microstructures, simulations of permeability at micro-scale, and to analyse the upscaling of permeability. The workflow is fully tested using two very different microtomographic datasets of carbonate samples with strong heterogeneity. The characterisation of microstructures includes not only routine parameters but also anisotropy of the pore-structure. The critical pore diameter is also obtained through morphological implementations. The method of stochastic analysis of extended local porosity theory is used to determine the sizes of representative volume elements (RVE). We demonstrate criteria for determining the size of the RVE and show a sample that satisfies the criterion. We also discuss a sample that does not suffice the RVE criterion, because of the strong anisotropy. Permeabilities are computed using Lattice-Boltzmann (LB) simulations on the RVE and compared with laboratory measurements. Techniques and procedures are used to extract scaling parameters for both of the samples including: 1) percolation threshold - by using a shrinking/expanding algorithm; 2) crossover length - by analysing the mass density; 3) the critical exponent of correlation length - by using the finite-size scaling scheme; and 4) the critical exponent of permeability - by running LB simulations on a series of derivative models close to the percolation threshold. Our results of critical exponents are different from the previous studies and the mass density distributions are irregular. This pilot study provides new information on the relationships between microstructures and permeability of natural rocks with complex microstructures. The study also reveals the scaling parameters. Our results clearly put into question whether natural rocks can be idealised by classical theoretical solutions. A robust workflow for embracing a computational approach of microstructures may provide a solution. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Deep learning models such as convolutional neural net- work have been widely used in 3D biomedical segmentation and achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, most of them often adapt a single modality or stack multiple modalities as different input channels. To better leverage the multi- modalities, we propose a deep encoder-decoder structure with cross-modality convolution layers to incorporate different modalities of MRI data. In addition, we exploit convolutional LSTM to model a sequence of 2D slices, and jointly learn the multi-modalities and convolutional LSTM in an end-to-end manner. To avoid converging to the certain labels, we adopt a re-weighting scheme and two-phase training to handle the label imbalance. Experimental results on BRATS-2015 show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art biomedical segmentation approaches.},

@article{Caglar2014,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Serum tumor markers and computed tomography (CT) are the most widely accepted monitoring tools for the follow-up patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Positron emission tomography (PET) with 18[F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is a promising modality for the evaluation of recurrent CRC. The purpose of this study was to (1) investigate the sensitivity and specificity of serum tumor marker assay, CT and FDG PET-CT, (2) determine the correlation of these markers with FDG PET-CT quantitative indices such as maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) in patients suspected to have recurrent CRC.

PATIENTS: FDG PET-CT imaging was performed in 212 patients with possible CRC recurrence. A retrospective study was performed on patients with (1) a history of CRC with complete remission after treatment, (2) pathology of adenocarcinoma and (3) increase in cancer antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) and/or carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) or suspicious radiological evaluation during follow-up after complete remission.

METHODS: All patients underwent integrated FDG PET-CT scan. Serum tumor markers were obtained within 3 months of PET-CT. All enrolled cases showed increase in a tumor marker over the reference value on at least two serial measurements or abnormal CT scan before PET-CT was performed. Results were compared with histopathological findings or clinical follow-up.

RESULTS: Following exclusion of 57 patients with missing data or lost to follow-up, 155 patients (87 men, mean age: 61 years) remained for final analysis. Serum CEA and CA 19-9 had a sensitivity of 74 and 35 {\%} and specificity of 86 and 83 {\%} for the detection recurrent CRC, respectively. The sensitivities of CT and FDG PET-CT were 79 and 92 {\%} and specificities were 45 and 100 {\%}, respectively. At an adaptive threshold of 42 {\%}, the median SUVmax, SUVmean, MTV and TLG of these lesions were 8.8, 5.2, 11.3 cm[Formula: see text] and 55.4, respectively. All FDG PET-CT quantitative parameters correlated positively with serum CEA levels, and the correlation coefficients were 0.45, 0.44 and 0.49 for SUVmax, MTV and TLG [Formula: see text].

CONCLUSION: PET-CT scan, CEA and CA-19-9 results were correlated. However, both tumor markers had poor sensitivity to detect metastatic disease. PET-CT is more accurate than CT in detecting recurrent CRC in this study. Majority of the recurrences were in the liver and the sensitivity is affected by tumor histology. The correlation between semiquantitative FDG PET parameters and serum tumor marker levels is moderate.},

abstract = {Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers high-resolution $\backslash$emph{\{}in vivo{\}} imaging and rich functional and anatomical multimodality tissue contrast. In practice, however, there are challenges associated with considerations of scanning costs, patient comfort, and scanning time that constrain how much data can be acquired in clinical or research studies. In this paper, we explore the possibility of generating high-resolution and multimodal images from low-resolution single-modality imagery. We propose the weakly-supervised joint convolutional sparse coding to simultaneously solve the problems of super-resolution (SR) and cross-modality image synthesis. The learning process requires only a few registered multimodal image pairs as the training set. Additionally, the quality of the joint dictionary learning can be improved using a larger set of unpaired images. To combine unpaired data from different image resolutions/modalities, a hetero-domain image alignment term is proposed. Local image neighborhoods are naturally preserved by operating on the whole image domain (as opposed to image patches) and using joint convolutional sparse coding. The paired images are enhanced in the joint learning process with unpaired data and an additional maximum mean discrepancy term, which minimizes the dissimilarity between their feature distributions. Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on both SR reconstruction and simultaneous SR and cross-modality synthesis.},

abstract = {The objective of the present study was to retrospectively analyze a cohort of patients who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer pulmonary metastases during a 12-year period. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The sample included 75 patients who were monitored in terms of overall survival (OS) and disease-free interval (DFI) in relation to patient's age, preoperative values of biomarkers, type of surgery, number and size of metastases, occurrence of complications and length of hospitalisation. RESULTS: A total of 95 surgical interventions were performed and 133 metastases were removed. Out of these, 28{\%} of patients were free of any signs of relapse or disease progression for 5 years after metastasectomy. Those with two or more metastases are 2.3-times more at risk of disease progression. Tissue polypeptide specific antigen (TPS) values above the 140 IU/l cut-off point increase the risk of progression 3.9-times. The five-year survival rate among the group was 45{\%}. Patients with 2 or more metastases are 2.7-times more at risk of death. TPS values above the 140 IU/l cut-off increase the risk of death 5.5 times, and carbohydrate antigen CA19-9 values above the 28 IU/ml cut-off point increase the risk of death by 3.2 times. CONCLUSION: The number of metastases and the preoperative TPS values are decisive prognostic factors influencing both OS and DFI.},

abstract = {In this short paper, accelerated three-dimensional computer simulations of vascular trees development, preserving physiological and haemodynamic features, are reported. The new computation schemes deal: (i). with the geometrical optimization of each newly created bifurcation; and (ii). with the recalculation of blood pressures and radii of vessels in the whole tree. A significant decrease of the computation time is obtained by replacing the global optimization by the fast updating algorithm allowing more complex structure to be simulated. A comparison between the new algorithms and the previous one is illustrated through the hepatic arterial tree.},

@article{Zheng2008,
abstract = {We propose an automatic four-chamber heart segmentation system for the quantitative functional analysis of the heart from cardiac computed tomography (CT) volumes. Two topics are discussed: heart modeling and automatic model fitting to an unseen volume. Heart modeling is a nontrivial task since the heart is a complex nonrigid organ. The model must be anatomically accurate, allow manual editing, and provide sufficient information to guide automatic detection and segmentation. Unlike previous work, we explicitly represent important landmarks (such as the valves and the ventricular septum cusps) among the control points of the model. The control points can be detected reliably to guide the automatic model fitting process. Using this model, we develop an efficient and robust approach for automatic heart chamber segmentation in 3-D CT volumes. We formulate the segmentation as a two-step learning problem: anatomical structure localization and boundary delineation. In both steps, we exploit the recent advances in learning discriminative models. A novel algorithm, marginal space learning (MSL), is introduced to solve the 9-D similarity transformation search problem for localizing the heart chambers. After determining the pose of the heart chambers, we estimate the 3-D shape through learning-based boundary delineation. The proposed method has been extensively tested on the largest dataset (with 323 volumes from 137 patients) ever reported in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, our system is the fastest with a speed of 4.0 s per volume (on a dual-core 3.2-GHz processor) for the automatic segmentation of all four chambers.},

@article{Klinder2009,
abstract = {For many orthopaedic, neurological, and oncological applications, an exact segmentation of the vertebral column including an identification of each vertebra is essential. However, although bony structures show high contrast in CT images, the segmentation and labelling of individual vertebrae is challenging. In this paper, we present a comprehensive solution for automatically detecting, identifying, and segmenting vertebrae in CT images. A framework has been designed that takes an arbitrary CT image, e.g., head-neck, thorax, lumbar, or whole spine, as input and provides a segmentation in form of labelled triangulated vertebra surface models. In order to obtain a robust processing chain, profound prior knowledge is applied through the use of various kinds of models covering shape, gradient, and appearance information. The framework has been tested on 64 CT images even including pathologies. In 56 cases, it was successfully applied resulting in a final mean point-to-surface segmentation error of 1.12+/-1.04mm. One key issue is a reliable identification of vertebrae. For a single vertebra, we achieve an identification success of more than 70{\%}. Increasing the number of available vertebrae leads to an increase in the identification rate reaching 100{\%} if 16 or more vertebrae are shown in the image.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: A model-based risk analysis for oncologic liver surgery was described in previous work (Preim et al. in Proceedings of international symposium on computer assisted radiology and surgery (CARS), Elsevier, Amsterdam, pp. 353–358, 2002; Hansen et al. Int I Comput Assist Radiol Surg 4(5):469–474, 2009). In this paper, we present an evaluation of this method.

METHODS: To prove whether and how the risk analysis facilitates the process of liver surgery planning, an explorative user study with 10 liver experts was conducted. The purpose was to compare and analyze their decision-making.

RESULTS: The results of the study show that model-based risk analysis enhances the awareness of surgical risk in the planning stage. Participants preferred smaller resection volumes and agreed more on the safety margins' width in case the risk analysis was available. In addition, time to complete the planning task and confidence of participants were not increased when using the risk analysis.

CONCLUSION: This work shows that the applied model-based risk analysis may influence important planning decisions in liver surgery. It lays a basis for further clinical evaluations and points out important fields for future research.},

A fundamental theorem is established to relate such moment invariants to the well-known algebraic invariants. Complete systems of moment invariants under translation, similitude and orthogonal transformations are derived. Some moment invariants under general two-dimensional linear transformations are also included. Both theoretical formulation and practical models of visual pattern recognition based upon these moment invariants are discussed. A simple simulation program together with its performance are also presented. It is shown that recognition of geometrical patterns and alphabetical characters independently of position, size and orientation can be accomplished. It is also indicated that generalization is possible to include invariance with parallel projection.},

abstract = {In the short time since publication of Boykov and Jolly's seminal paper [3], graph cuts have become well established as a leading method in 2D and 3D semi-automated image segmentation. Although this approach is computationally feasible for many tasks, the memory overhead and supralinear time complexity of leading algorithms results in an excessive computational burden for high-resolution data. In this paper, we introduce a multilevel banded heuristic for computation of graph cuts that is motivated by the well-known narrow band algorithm in level set computation. We perform a number of numerical experiments to show that this heuristic drastically reduces both the running time and the memory consumption of graph cuts while producing nearly the same segmentation result as the conventional graph cuts. Additionally, we are able to characterize the type of segmentation target for which our multilevel banded heuristic will yield different results from the conventional graph cuts. The proposed method has been applied to both 2D and 3D images with promising results. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate a software tool for non-invasive preoperative volumetric assessment of potential donors in living donated liver transplantation (LDLT). Biphasic helical CT was performed in 56 potential donors. Data sets were post-processed using a non-commercial software tool for segmentation, volumetric analysis and visualisation of liver segments. Semi-automatic definition of liver margins allowed the segmentation of parenchyma. Hepatic vessels were delineated using a region-growing algorithm with automatically determined thresholds. Volumes and shapes of liver segments were calculated automatically based on individual portal-venous branches. Results were visualised three-dimensionally and statistically compared with conventional volumetry and the intraoperative findings in 27 transplanted cases. Image processing was easy to perform within 23 min. Of the 56 potential donors, 27 were excluded from LDLT because of inappropriate liver parenchyma or vascular architecture. Two recipients were not transplanted due to poor clinical conditions. In the 27 transplanted cases, preoperatively visualised vessels were confirmed, and only one undetected accessory hepatic vein was revealed. Calculated graft volumes were 1110 +/- 180 ml for right lobes, 820 ml for the left lobe and 270 +/- 30 ml for segments II+III. The calculated volumes and intraoperatively measured graft volumes correlated significantly. No significant differences between the presented automatic volumetry and the conventional volumetry were observed. A novel image processing technique was evaluated which allows a semi-automatic volume calculation and 3D visualisation of the different liver segments.},

abstract = {For a number of computational purposes, including visualization of scientific data and registration of multimodal medical data, smooth curves must be approximated by polygonal curves, and surfaces by polyhedral surfaces. An inherent problem of these approximation algorithms is that the resulting curves and surfaces appear faceted. Boundary-following and iso-surface construction algorithms are typical examples. To reduce the apparent faceting, smoothing methods are used. In this paper, we introduce a new method for smoothing piecewise linear shapes of arbitrary dimension and topology. This new method is in fact a linear low-pass filter that removes high-curvature variations, and does not produce shrinkage. Its computational complexity is linear in the number of edges or faces of the shape, and the required storage is linear in the number of vertices},

abstract = {Significant advances have been made in understanding the role of tumor angiogenesis and its influence on tumor progression in cancer. Based on this knowledge, a series of inhibitors of angiogenesis have been developed and evaluated in preclinical and clinical trials. Since detailed information of tumor progression in response to therapy is important to assess the efficacy of anti-tumor treatment in vivo, noninvasive imaging techniques emerge more and more as important tools to monitor alterations in tumor growth and vessel recruitment, as well as metastatic spread over time. So far, remarkable efforts have been made to improve the technical capability of these imaging modalities based on better resolution, as well as to implement multimodal approaches combining molecular with anatomical information. Advanced imaging techniques not only allow the detection and monitoring of tumor development, but also facilitate a broad understanding of the cellular and molecular events that propagate tumor angiogenesis, as well as those occurring in response to therapy. This review provides an overview of different imaging techniques in preclinical settings of oncological research and discusses their potential impact on clinical translation. Imaging modalities will be presented that have been implemented to address key biological issues by exploring tumor angiogenic processes and evaluating antiangiogenic therapy.},

abstract = {This work is concerned with the automatic speaker adaptation of an
acoustic model in

the automatic speech recognition system. For the model training, it
is necessary to have large

amount of data from many speakers. The final model, speaker independent,
is then able to

recognize speech from any speaker.

When speaker's identity is known, we could lower the error rate by
using a model trained

on the data from the particular speaker. Such a model is called speaker
dependent model.

The main problem with the construction of speaker dependent model
is the need for large

database of utterances from one speaker. This problem is often non-solvable
in real conditions,

however, it can be overcome by adaptation techniques. The model is
adapted on the specific

speaker as well as on acoustic conditions (e.g. additive noise, channel
distortion) in the test

utterance.

The aim of this work is to discuss the methods for adaptation and
the procedures of

adaptation training. Some of these methods were tested and the experiments
shown, that

adaptation has a significant benefit for automatic speech recognition
systems.},

abstract = {Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death in men and women in the United States. This article provides an overview of colorectal cancer statistics, including the most current data on incidence, survival, and mortality rates and trends. Incidence data were provided by the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Mortality data were provided by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2014, an estimated 71,830 men and 65,000 women will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer and 26,270 men and 24,040 women will die of the disease. Greater than one-third of all deaths (29{\%} in men and 43{\%} in women) will occur in individuals aged 80 years and older. There is substantial variation in tumor location by age. For example, 26{\%} of colorectal cancers in women aged younger than 50 years occur in the proximal colon, compared with 56{\%} of cases in women aged 80 years and older. Incidence and death rates are highest in blacks and lowest in Asians/Pacific Islanders; among males during 2006 through 2010, death rates in blacks (29.4 per 100,000 population) were more than double those in Asians/Pacific Islanders (13.1) and 50{\%} higher than those in non-Hispanic whites (19.2). Overall, incidence rates decreased by approximately 3{\%} per year during the past decade (2001-2010). Notably, the largest drops occurred in adults aged 65 and older. For instance, rates for tumors located in the distal colon decreased by more than 5{\%} per year. In contrast, rates increased during this time period among adults younger than 50 years. Colorectal cancer death rates declined by approximately 2{\%} per year during the 1990s and by approximately 3{\%} per year during the past decade. Progress in reducing colorectal cancer death rates can be accelerated by improving access to and use of screening and standard treatment in all populations.},

@article{Cebasek2010,
abstract = {Capillary supply of individual skeletal muscle fibers is usually evaluated from two-dimensional (2D) images of thin transverse sections by the number of capillary profiles around a fiber (CAF). This method is inherently inaccurate and the resulting capillary length measurement errors can be avoided by using an alternative three-dimensional (3D) approach where the mean length of capillaries around individual muscle fibers per fiber length (Lcap/Lfib) is measured from 3D images acquired by confocal microscopy. We quantified the error of the 2D method and its reduction by using a 3D approach in realistic geometrical models of muscle fiber capillary bed and in true muscle samples. In models we showed that Lcap/Lfib was sensitive to different arrangements of capillaries, while CAF underestimated capillarization since it could not detect the increased length of capillary bed. In true muscle samples, we detected statistically significant differences in the capillary supply of control and denervated rat soleus muscles by both 2D and 3D methods. Lcap/Lfib was larger than CAF in control muscles reflecting their more complicated capillary bed. Thus, 3D approach is more sensitive in agreement with the analysis of geometrical models. We conclude that the 3D method, though technically more demanding than 2D method, represents a more precise approach to evaluation of muscle capillarization. Moreover, the 3D method could be applied to other organs and we suggest potential medical applications.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, Springer International Publishing AG. The paper summarizes our activities in modelling tissue perfusion using a multilevel approach which is based on information retrievable form CT and micro CT images. We focus on the liver tissue for which the perfusion modelling is of great interest for both medical research and clinical practice. The blood flow in liver is characterized at several scales for which different models are used. Flows in upper hierarchies represented by larger branching vessels are described using simple 1D models based on the Bernoulli equation extended by the Poiseuille correction terms to respect the viscous pressure losses. To describe flows in smaller vessels and in the tissue parenchyma, we propose a 3D continuum model of porous medium defined in terms of hierarchically matched compartments characterized by hydraulic permeabilities. The 1D models corresponding to the portal and hepatic veins are coupled with the 3D model through point sources, or sinks. For the lowermost level representing the quasi-periodic lobular structure we apply the homogenization method which provides the permeability features of the hepatic sinusoids considered as the double porosity. In the paper we discuss several approaches how to determine the flow model parameters which can be combined. Also the model validation using the realistic geometries reconstructed using the CT scans is discussed.},

abstract = {Early changes in branching geometry of microvasculature and its associated impact on the perfusion distribution in diseases, especially those in which different branching generations are affected differently, require the ability to analyze intact vascular trees over a wide range of scales. Micro-CT offers an excellent framework to analyze the microvascular branching geometry. Such an analysis requires methods to be developed that can accurately characterize branching properties, such as branch diameter, length, branching angle, and branch interconnectivity of the microvasculature. The purpose of this article is to report the results of a study of two human intramyocardial coronary vascular tree casts in which the accuracy of micro-CT vascular imaging and its analysis are tested against measurements made through an optical microscope (used as the "gold-standard"). Methods related to image segmentation of the vascular lumen, vessel tree centerline extraction, individual branch segment measurement, and compensating for the non-ideal modulation transfer function of micro-CT scanners are presented. The extracted centerline accurately characterized the hierarchical structure of the vascular tree casts in terms of "parent-branch" relationships which allowed each interbranch segments' dimensions to be compared to the optical measurement method. The comparison results show a close to ideal 1:1 relationship for both length and diameter measurements made by the two methods. Combining the results from both specimens, the standard deviation of the difference between measurement methods was 19 microm for the measurement of interbranch segment diameters (ranging from 12 to 769 microm), and 172 microm for the measurement of interbranch segment lengths (ranging from 14 to 3252 microm). These results suggest that our micro-CT image analysis method can be used to characterize a vascular tree's hierarchical structure, and accurately measure interbranch segment lengths and diameters.},

abstract = {Up to a fifth of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) present with synchronous hepatic metastases. In patients with CRC who present without intestinal obstruction or perforation and in whom comprehensive whole-body imaging confirms the absence of extrahepatic disease, evidence indicates a state of equipoise between several different management pathways, none of which has demonstrated superiority. Neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy is advocated by current guidelines, but must be integrated with surgical management in order to remove the primary tumour and liver metastatic burden. Surgery for CRC with synchronous liver metastases can take a number of forms: the 'classic' approach, involving initial colorectal resection, interval chemotherapy and liver resection as the final step; simultaneous removal of the liver and bowel tumours with neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy; or a 'liver-first' approach (before or after systemic chemotherapy) with removal of the colorectal tumour as the final procedure. In patients with rectal primary tumours, the liver-first approach can potentially avoid rectal surgery in patients with a complete response to chemoradiotherapy. We overview the importance of precise nomenclature, the influence of clinical presentation on treatment options, and the need for accurate, up-to-date surgical terminology, staging tests and contemporary management options in CRC and synchronous hepatic metastatic disease, with an emphasis on multidisciplinary care.},

abstract = {The morphological homogeneity of the liver parenchyma has represented a major obstacle in finding an acceptable definition of the structural/functional units of the liver. Concepts such as the "lobule," the "portal unit" and the "acinus" remain debatable. This study investigates the modular microarchitecture on the basis of the lobular concept. Using alkaline phosphatase activity as a histochemical marker, modules could be recognized clearly. In autopsy specimens of human liver, modules were traced through sequential cryosections, and a "secondary" module having a height of 1.9 mm, a surface of 14.7 mm(2), and a volume of 5.1 mm(3) was reconstructed three-dimensionally. It was subdivided into 14 "primary" modules by portal tracts and vascular septa and by a common draining central venular tree. Primary modules were polyhedral, with seven to nine facets, having heights from 0.3 to 0.9 mm, surface areas from 1.7 to 5.0 mm(2), and volumes from 0.1 to 0.9 mm(3). Such variation in shape and size is considered an important part of the modular organization of the human liver. In conclusion, the findings on the three-dimensionality and microcirculation of liver modules support and extend the lobular concept and, at the same time, make apparent the shortcomings of the concepts of acinar and portal units. The results of this study should permit a better interpretation of histological sections of normal and pathological liver and provide a basis for understanding the metabolic heterogeneity of liver cells and their functional integration into parenchymal units.},

abstract = {After [15], [31], [19], [8], [25], [5], minimum cut/maximum flow algorithms on graphs emerged as an increasingly useful tool for exact or approximate energy minimization in low-level vision. The combinatorial optimization literature provides many min-cut/max-flow algorithms with different polynomial time complexity. Their practical efficiency, however, has to date been studied mainly outside the scope of computer vision. The goal of this paper is to provide an experimental comparison of the efficiency of min-cut/max flow algorithms for applications in vision. We compare the running times of several standard algorithms, as well as a new algorithm that we have recently developed. The algorithms we study include both Goldberg-Tarjan style "push-relabel" methods and algorithms based on Ford-Fulkerson style "augmenting paths." We benchmark these algorithms on a number of typical graphs in the contexts of image restoration, stereo, and segmentation. In many cases, our new algorithm works several times faster than any of the other methods, making near real-time performance possible. An implementation of our max-flow/min-cut algorithm is available upon request for research purposes.},

abstract = {Histological alterations often constitute a fingerprint of toxicity and diseases. The extent to which these alterations are cause or consequence of compromised organ function, and the underlying mechanisms involved is a matter of intensive research. In particular, liver disease is often associated with altered tissue microarchitecture, which in turn may compromise perfusion and functionality. Research in this field requires the development and orchestration of new techniques into standardized processing pipelines that can be used to reproducibly quantify tissue architecture. Major bottlenecks include the lack of robust staining, and adequate reconstruction and quantification techniques. To bridge this gap, we established protocols employing specific antibody combinations for immunostaining, confocal imaging, three-dimensional reconstruction of approximately 100-$\mu$m-thick tissue blocks and quantification of key architectural features. We describe a standard procedure termed 'liver architectural staining' for the simultaneous visualization of bile canaliculi, sinusoidal endothelial cells, glutamine synthetase (GS) for the identification of central veins, and DAPI as a nuclear marker. Additionally, we present a second standard procedure entitled 'S-phase staining', where S-phase-positive and S-phase-negative nuclei (stained with BrdU and DAPI, respectively), sinusoidal endothelial cells and GS are stained. The techniques include three-dimensional reconstruction of the sinusoidal and bile canalicular networks from the same tissue block, and robust capture of position, size and shape of individual hepatocytes, as well as entire lobules from the same tissue specimen. In addition to the protocols, we have also established image analysis software that allows relational and hierarchical quantifications of different liver substructures (e.g. cells and vascular branches) and events (e.g. cell proliferation and death). Typical results acquired for routinely quantified parameters in adult mice (C57Bl6/N) include the hepatocyte volume (5,128.3 ± 837.8 $\mu$m(3)) and the fraction of the hepatocyte surface in contact with the neighbouring hepatocytes (67.4 ± 6.7 {\%}), sinusoids (22.1 ± 4.8 {\%}) and bile canaliculi (9.9 ± 3.8 {\%}). Parameters of the sinusoidal network that we also routinely quantify include the radius of the sinusoids (4.8 ± 2.25 $\mu$m), the branching angle (32.5 ± 11.2°), the length of intersection branches (23.93 ± 5.9 $\mu$m), the number of intersection nodes per mm(3) (120.3 × 103 ± 42.1 × 10(3)), the average length of sinusoidal vessel per mm(3) (5.4 × 10(3) ± 1.4 × 10(3)mm) and the percentage of vessel volume in relation to the whole liver volume (15.3 ± 3.9) (mean ± standard deviation). Moreover, the provided parameters of the bile canalicular network are: length of the first-order branches (7.5 ± 0.6 $\mu$m), length of the second-order branches (10.9 ± 1.8 $\mu$m), length of the dead-end branches (5.9 ± 0.7 $\mu$m), the number of intersection nodes per mm(3) (819.1 × 10(3) ± 180.7 × 10(3)), the number of dead-end branches per mm(3) (409.9 × 10(3) ± 95.6 × 10(3)), the length of the bile canalicular network per mm(3) (9.4 × 10(3) ± 0.7 × 10(3) mm) and the percentage of the bile canalicular volume with respect to the total liver volume (3.4 ± 0.005). A particular strength of our technique is that quantitative parameters of hepatocytes and bile canalicular as well as sinusoidal networks can be extracted from the same tissue block. Reconstructions and quantifications performed as described in the current protocols can be used for quantitative mathematical modelling of the underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, protocols are presented for both human and pig livers. The technique is also applicable for both vibratome blocks and conventional paraffin slices.},

abstract = {Visual patterns in animals may serve different functions, such as attracting mates and deceiving predators. If a signal is used for multiple functions, the opportunity arises for conflict among the different functions, preventing optimization for any one visual signal. Here we investigate the hypothesis that spatial separation of different visual signal functions has occurred in Bicyclus butterflies. Using phylogenetic reconstructions of character evolution and comparisons of evolutionary rates, we found dorsal surface characters to evolve at higher rates than ventral characters. Dorsal characters also displayed sex-based differences in evolutionary rates more often than did ventral characters. Thus, dorsal characters corresponded to our predictions of mate signalling while ventral characters appear to play an important role in predator avoidance. Forewing characters also fit a model of mate signalling, and displayed higher rates of evolution than hindwing characters. Our results, as well as the behavioural and developmental data from previous studies of Bicyclus species, support the hypothesis that spatial separation of visual signal functions has occurred in Bicyclus butterflies. This study is the first to demonstrate, in a phylogenetic framework, that spatial separation of signals used for mate signalling and those used for predator avoidance is a viable strategy to accommodate multiple signal functions. This signalling strategy has important ramifications on the developmental evolution of wing pattern elements and diversification of butterfly species. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Volume segmentation is a relatively slow process and, in certain circumstances, the enormous amount of prior knowledge available is underused. Model-based liver segmentation suffers from the large shape variability of this organ, and from structures of similar appearance that juxtapose the liver. The technique presented in this paper is devoted to combine a statistical analysis of the data with a reconstruction model from sparse information: only the most reliable information in the image is used, and the rest of the liver's shape is inferred from the model and the sparse observation. The resulting process is more efficient than standard segmentation since most of the workload is concentrated on the critical points, but also more robust, since the interpolated volume is consistent with the prior knowledge statistics. The experimental results on liver datasets prove the sparse information model has the same potential as PCA, if not better, to represent the shape of the liver. Furthermore, the performance assessment from measurement statistics on the liver's volume, distance between reconstructed surfaces and ground truth, and inter-observer variability demonstrates the liver is efficiently segmented using sparse information.},

abstract = {We consider the automated recognition of human actions in surveillance videos. Most current methods build classifiers based on complex handcrafted features computed from the raw inputs. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a type of deep model that can act directly on the raw inputs. However, such models are currently limited to handling 2D inputs. In this paper, we develop a novel 3D CNN model for action recognition. This model extracts features from both the spatial and the temporal dimensions by performing 3D convolutions, thereby capturing the motion information encoded in multiple adjacent frames. The developed model generates multiple channels of information from the input frames, and the final feature representation combines information from all channels. To further boost the performance, we propose regularizing the outputs with high-level features and combining the predictions of a variety of different models. We apply the developed models to recognize human actions in the real-world environment of airport surveillance videos, and they achieve superior performance in comparison to baseline methods.},

abstract = {Number of particles in an organ or region is a valuable data as well as the volume. Many techniques have been developed for the estimation of total number or numerical density of cells in tissues and organs. The quality and reliability of each method has constantly been increased compared to its predecessors. Numerical density is one of the parameters that is used to assess the association between a structure and its function. It should be kept in mind that reliability of biological comments derived from the data is dependent on the method that is used for quantitative estimation of parameters. As stated previously, one of the most important morphometric parameters in biological studies is the ‘number'. Since the ‘number' has no-dimensions (i.e. Is not bounded by any dimensional property) it could not be directly estimated using a 2D section plane. A good alternative is to use a “volume probe” generated by two consecutive sections, which is called the disector. The disector counting method that was developed by Stereo in 1984 is the most efficient and unbiased solution for particle counting. In this review we will summarize the basic principles of the disector approach and give some examples focused especially on some basic topics in neuroscience research.},

abstract = {Most vision research embracing the spatial frequency paradigm has been conceptually and mathematically a one-dimensional analysis of two-dimensional mechanisms. Spatial vision models and the experiments sustaining them have generally treated spatial frequency as a one-dimensional variable, even though receptive fields and retinal images are two-dimensional and linear transform theory obliges any frequency analysis to preserve dimension. Four models of cortical receptive fields are introduced and studied here in 2D form, in order to illustrate the relationship between their excitatory/inhibitory spatial structure and their resulting 2D spectral properties. It emerges that only a very special analytic class of receptive fields possess independent tuning functions for spatial frequency and orientation; namely, those profiles whose two-dimensional Fourier Transforms are expressible as the separable product of a radial function and an angular function. Furthermore, only such receptive fields would have the same orientation tuning curve for single bars as for gratings. All classes lacking this property would describe cells responsive to different orientations for different spatial frequencies and vice versa; this is shown to be the case, for example, for the Hubel {\&} Wiesel model of cortical orientation-tuned simple cells receiving inputs from an aligned row of center/surround LGN cells. When these results are considered in conjunction with psychophysical evidence for nonseparability of spatial frequency and orientation tuning properties within a {\^{a}} channel{\^{a}}, it becomes mandatory that future spatial vision research of the Fourier genre take on an explicitly two-dimensional character.},

abstract = {This paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge.},

abstract = {X-ray phase contrast micro computed tomography (micro-CT) can non-destructively provide the internal structure information of soft tissues and low atomic number materials. It has become an invaluable analysis tool for biomedical specimens. Here an in-line phase contrast micro-CT reconstruction technique is reported, which consists of a projection extraction method and the conventional filter back-projection (FBP) reconstruction algorithm. The projection extraction is implemented by applying the Fourier transform to the forward projections of in-line phase contrast micro-CT. This work comprises a numerical study of the method and its experimental verification using a biomedical specimen dataset measured at an X-ray tube source micro-CT setup. The numerical and experimental results demonstrate that the presented technique can improve the imaging contrast of biomedical specimens. It will be of interest for a wide range of in-line phase contrast micro-CT applications in medicine and biology.},

abstract = {We present algorithms for the automatic and precise segmentation of individual vertebras in CT Volume data. When a local surface evolution method such as the level set is applied to such a complex structure, global shape priors will not be sufficient to avoid the leakage and local minima problems, particularly if precise object boundary is desired. We propose a prior knowledge base that contains localized priors--a group of high-level features whose detection will augment the surface model and be the key to success. Base on this a set of context blockers are applied to prevent the leakages. Carefully designed initial surface when registered with the data helps avoid the local minimum problem. The results of segmentation well approximate the human delineated object boundaries. We also present the validation result of the segmentation of 150 vertebras.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physical assessment of breathing is an important component of physical therapy evaluations. However, there are no standardized reference values of breathing movements available for use in clinical practice. The purpose of this study was to determine the 3-dimensional distances of observational points on the thorax and abdomen during breathing in healthy subjects and to assess the effects of age, posture, and sex on breathing movements. METHODS: We studied the 3-dimensional breathing movement distances of the thorax and abdomen in 100 healthy subjects (50 males, 50 females). Breathing movements were measured with a 3-dimensional motion system during quiet and deep breathing with subjects in supine and sitting positions. Thirteen reflective markers were placed on the upper (the clavicles, 3rd ribs, and sternal angle) and lower thorax (the 8th ribs, 10th ribs, and xiphoid process) and the abdomen (upper abdomen and lateral abdomen). Range of movement in both breathing conditions was measured as the 3-dimensional distance at half respiratory cycle. Respiratory rates were calculated based on the breathing movements analyzed. One-way analysis of variance, t tests, and multiple regression were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The average marker distances for the thorax and abdomen during quiet breathing were less than one third of those during deep breathing. Upper thoracic movement was significantly decreased with age. There was less abdominal movement in females than in males, except during quiet breathing in the supine position. The distances between the thoracic markers were greater and those of the abdomen were less during quiet and deep breathing in the sitting position, compared with those in the supine position. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the observed breathing movements were related to the effects of age, sex, and posture. These findings are in agreement with those reported in previous studies. The results may be helpful in assessing breathing movement by physical examination.},

abstract = {Naive Bayes is one of the most efficient and effective inductive learning algorithms for machine learning and data mining. Its competitive performance in classifica- tion is surprising, because the conditional independence assumption on which it is based, is rarely true in real- world applications. An open question is: what is the true reason for the surprisingly good performance of naive Bayes in classification?In this paper, we propose a novel explanation on the superb classification performance of naive Bayes. We show that, essentially, the dependence distribution; i.e., how the local dependence of a node distributes in each class, evenly or unevenly, and how the local dependen- cies of all nodes work together, consistently (support- ing a certain classification) or inconsistently (cancel- ing each other out), plays a crucial role. Therefore, no matter how strong the dependences among attributes are, naive Bayes can still be optimal if the dependences distribute evenly in classes, or if the dependences can- cel each other out. We propose and prove a sufficient and necessary conditions for the optimality of naive Bayes. Further, we investigate the optimality of naive Bayes under the Gaussian distribution. We present and prove a sufficient condition for the optimality of naive Bayes, in which the dependence between attributes do exist. This provides evidence that dependence among attributes may cancel out each other. In addition, we explore when naive Bayes works well.},

abstract = {Texture is one of the important characteristics used in identifying objects or regions of interest in an image, whether the image be a photomicrograph, an aerial photograph, or a satellite image. This paper describes some easily computable textural features based on gray-tone spatial dependancies, and illustrates their application in category-identification tasks of three different kinds of image data: photomicrographs of five kinds of sandstones, 1:20 000 panchromatic aerial photographs of eight land-use categories, and Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS) multispecial imagery containing seven land-use categories. We use two kinds of decision rules: one for which the decision regions are convex polyhedra (a piecewise linear decision rule), and one for which the decision regions are rectangular parallelpipeds (a min-max decision rule). In each experiment the data set was divided into two parts, a training set and a test set. Test set identification accuracy is 89 percent for the photomicrographs, 82 percent for the aerial photographic imagery, and 83 percent for the satellite imagery. These results indicate that the easily computable textural features probably have a general applicability for a wide variety of image-classification applications.},

We focus on optimizing the algorithm for processing data, in which the target object occupies only a small portion of the total volume. We propose a two-step procedure. At the first step, the location of the object is determined roughly. At the second step, Graph-Cut segmentation is performed with a special multi-scale chart structure. Two different graph construction methods are suggested. The calculation time of both variants is compared with the original Graph-Cut method. The msgc{\_}lo2hi method has been shown to provide a statistically significant time reduction of the computational costs.},

abstract = {The local binary pattern approach has evolved to represent a significant breakthrough in texture analysis, outperforming earlier methods in many applications. Perhaps the most important property of the LBP operator in real-world applications is its tolerance against illumination changes. Another equally important is its computational simplicity, which makes it possible to analyze images in challenging real-time settings. Recently, we have begun to study image analysis tasks which have not been generally considered texture analysis problems. Our excellent results suggest that that texture and the ideas behind the LBP methodology could have a much wider role in image analysis and computer vision than was thought before.},

abstract = {This paper explores the use of extreme points in an object (left-most, right-most, top, bottom pixels) as input to obtain precise object segmentation for images and videos. We do so by adding an extra channel to the image in the input of a convolutional neural network (CNN), which contains a Gaussian centered in each of the extreme points. The CNN learns to transform this information into a segmentation of an object that matches those extreme points. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach for guided segmentation (grabcut-style), interactive segmentation, video object segmentation, and dense segmentation annotation. We show that we obtain the most precise results to date, also with less user input, in an extensive and varied selection of benchmarks and datasets. All our models and code are publicly available on http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/{\~{}}cvlsegmentation/dextr/.},

@article{Hoehme2010,
abstract = {Only little is known about how cells coordinately behave to establish functional tissue structure and restore microarchitecture during regeneration. Research in this field is hampered by a lack of techniques that allow quantification of tissue architecture and its development. To bridge this gap, we have established a procedure based on confocal laser scans, image processing, and three-dimensional tissue reconstruction, as well as quantitative mathematical modeling. As a proof of principle, we reconstructed and modeled liver regeneration in mice after damage by CCl(4), a prototypical inducer of pericentral liver damage. We have chosen the regenerating liver as an example because of the tight link between liver architecture and function: the complex microarchitecture formed by hepatocytes and microvessels, i.e. sinusoids, ensures optimal exchange of metabolites between blood and hepatocytes. Our model captures all hepatocytes and sinusoids of a liver lobule during a 16 days regeneration process. The model unambiguously predicted a so-far unrecognized mechanism as essential for liver regeneration, whereby daughter hepatocytes align along the orientation of the closest sinusoid, a process which we named "hepatocyte-sinusoid alignment" (HSA). The simulated tissue architecture was only in agreement with the experimentally obtained data when HSA was included into the model and, moreover, no other likely mechanism could replace it. In order to experimentally validate the model of prediction of HSA, we analyzed the three-dimensional orientation of daughter hepatocytes in relation to the sinusoids. The results of this analysis clearly confirmed the model prediction. We believe our procedure is widely applicable in the systems biology of tissues.},

@phdthesis{Laws1980,
abstract = {The problem of image texture analysis is introduced, and existing approaches are surveyed. An empirical evaluation method is applied to two texture measurement systems, co-occurrence statistics and augmented correlation statistics. A spatial-statistical class of texture measures is then defined and evaluated. It leads to a simple class of texture energy transforms, which perform better than any of the preceding methods. These transforms are very fast, and can be made invariant to changes in luminance, contrast, and rotation without histogram equalization or other preprocessing. Texture energy is measured by filtering with small masks, typically 5x5, then with a moving-window average of the absolute image values. This method, similar to human visual processing, is appropriate for textures with short coherence length or correlation distance. The filter masks are integer-valued and separable, and can be implemented with one-dimensional or 3x3 convolutions. The averaging operation is also very fast, with computing time independent of window size. Texture energy planes may be linearly combined to form a smaller number of discriminant planes. These principal component planes seem to represent natural texture dimensions, and to be more reliable texture measures than the texture energy planes. Texture segmentation or classification may be accomplished using either texture energy or principal component planes as input. This study classified 15x15 blocks of eight natural textures. Accuracies of 72{\%} were achieved with co-occurrence statistics, 65{\%} with augmented correlation statistics, and 94{\%} with texture energy statistics. (Author)},

abstract = {This paper investigates two fundamental problems in computer vision: contour detection and image segmentation. We present state-of-the-art algorithms for both of these tasks. Our contour detector combines multiple local cues into a globalization framework based on spectral clustering. Our segmentation algorithm consists of generic machinery for transforming the output of any contour detector into a hierarchical region tree. In this manner, we reduce the problem of image segmentation to that of contour detection. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that both our contour detection and segmentation methods significantly outperform competing algorithms. The automatically generated hierarchical segmentations can be interactively refined by user-specified annotations. Computation at multiple image resolutions provides a means of coupling our system to recognition applications.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: A model-based risk analysis for oncologic liver surgery was described in previous work (Preim et al. in Proceedings of international symposium on computer assisted radiology and surgery (CARS), Elsevier, Amsterdam, pp. 353–358, 2002; Hansen et al. Int I Comput Assist Radiol Surg 4(5):469–474, 2009). In this paper, we present an evaluation of this method. METHODS: To prove whether and how the risk analysis facilitates the process of liver surgery planning, an explorative user study with 10 liver experts was conducted. The purpose was to compare and analyze their decision-making. RESULTS: The results of the study show that model-based risk analysis enhances the awareness of surgical risk in the planning stage. Participants preferred smaller resection volumes and agreed more on the safety margins' width in case the risk analysis was available. In addition, time to complete the planning task and confidence of participants were not increased when using the risk analysis. CONCLUSION: This work shows that the applied model-based risk analysis may influence important planning decisions in liver surgery. It lays a basis for further clinical evaluations and points out important fields for future research.},

abstract = {Whether you are a statistician, engineer, or businessperson, you need statistics. You want to be able to easily reference tables, find formulas, and know how to use them so you can extract information from data without getting bogged down by advanced statistical methods. Your goal is to determine the appropriate statistical procedures and interpret the results. Standard Probability and Statistics: Tables and Formulae provides the tools you need to do just that. Logically organized and reaching far beyond a mere catalog, a textual description accompanies each entry- most include an example. The topics addressed are directly applicable to modern business and engineering as well as to statistics, including regression analysis, ANOVA, decision theory, signal processing, and control theory. The result is an accessible, example-oriented handbook that supplies the basic principles, the most commonly used values, and the information to make them work for you. It is easy to fill a statistics reference with hundreds of pages of tables - sometimes for just one test. This handbook is much more. With topics ranging from classical statistics to modern applications, Standard Probability and Statistics fills the need for an up-to-date, authoritative statistics reference.},

abstract = {There have been significant efforts to build a probabilistic atlas of the brain and to use it for many common applications, such as segmentation and registration. Though the work related to brain atlases can be applied to nonbrain organs, less attention has been paid to actually building an atlas for organs other than the brain. Motivated by the automatic identification of normal organs for applications in radiation therapy treatment planning, we present a method to construct a probabilistic atlas of an abdomen consisting of four organs (i.e., liver, kidneys, and spinal cord). Using 32 noncontrast abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans, 31 were mapped onto one individual scan using thin plate spline as the warping transform and mutual information (MI) as the similarity measure. Except for an initial coarse placement of four control points by the operators, the MI-based registration was automatic. Additionally, the four organs in each of the 32 CT data sets were manually segmented. The manual segmentations were warped onto the "standard" patient space using the same transform computed from their gray scale CT data set and a probabilistic atlas was calculated. Then, the atlas was used to aid the segmentation of low-contrast organs in an additional 20 CT data sets not included in the atlas. By incorporating the atlas information into the Bayesian framework, segmentation results clearly showed improvements over a standard unsupervised segmentation method.},

abstract = {Stereology offers a number of tools for the analysis of sections in microscopy (which usually provide only two-dimensional information) for the purpose of estimating geometric quantities, such as volume, surface area, length or number of particles (cells or other structures). The use of these tools enables recovery of the three-dimensional information that is inherent in biological tissues. This review uses the liver as a paradigm for summarizing the most commonly used state-of-the-art methods for quantitation in design-based stereology. Because it is often relevant to distinguish hyperplasia and hypertrophy in liver responses, we also focus on potential pitfalls in the sampling and processing of liver specimens for stereological purposes, and assess the existing methods for volume and number estimation. With respect to volume, we considered whole liver volume (V), volume density (V(V)) and so-called local volumes, including the number-weighted volume (V(N)) and the volume-weighted volume (V(V)). For number, we considered the total number (N) and the numerical density (N(V)). If correctly applied, current stereological methods guarantee that no bias is introduced in the estimates, which will be therefore accurate; additionally, methods can be tuned for obtaining precise quantitative estimates that can reveal subtle changes in the volume or number of selected hepatic cells. These methods have already detailed the effects of some substances and specific diets on the liver, and should be routinely included in the toolbox of liver research.},

abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been recently employed to solve problems from both the computer vision and medical image analysis fields. Despite their popularity, most approaches are only able to process 2D images while most medical data used in clinical practice consists of 3D volumes. In this work we propose an approach to 3D image segmentation based on a volumetric, fully convolutional, neural network. Our CNN is trained end-to-end on MRI volumes depicting prostate, and learns to predict segmentation for the whole volume at once. We introduce a novel objective function, that we optimise during training, based on Dice coefficient. In this way we can deal with situations where there is a strong imbalance between the number of foreground and background voxels. To cope with the limited number of annotated volumes available for training, we augment the data applying random non-linear transformations and histogram matching. We show in our experimental evaluation that our approach achieves good performances on challenging test data while requiring only a fraction of the processing time needed by other previous methods.},

@article{Selle2002,
abstract = {For liver surgical planning, the structure and morphology of the hepatic vessels and their relationship to tumors are of major interest. To achieve a fast and robust assistance with optimal quantitative and visual information, we present methods for a geometrical and structural analysis of vessel systems. Starting from the raw image data a sequence of image processing steps has to be carried out until a three-dimensional representation of the relevant anatomic and pathologic structures is generated. Based on computed tomography (CT) scans, the following steps are performed. 1) The volume data is preprocessed and the vessels are segmented. 2) The skeleton of the vessels is determined and transformed into a graph enabling a geometrical and structural shape analysis. Using this information the different intrahepatic vessel systems are identified automatically. 3) Based on the structural analysis of the branches of the portal vein, their vascular territories are approximated with different methods. These methods are compared and validated anatomically by means of corrosion casts of human livers. 4) Vessels are visualized with graphics primitives fitted to the skeleton to provide smooth visualizations without aliasing artifacts. The image analysis techniques have been evaluated in the clinical environment and have been used in more than 170 cases so far to plan interventions and transplantations.},

@article{Lazebnik2005,
abstract = {This paper introduces a texture representation suitable for recognizing images of textured surfaces under a wide range of transformations, including viewpoint changes and nonrigid deformations. At the feature extraction stage, a sparse set of affine Harris and Laplacian regions is found in the image. Each of these regions can be thought of as a texture element having a characteristic elliptic shape and a distinctive appearance pattern. This pattern is captured in an affine-invariant fashion via a process of shape normalization followed by the computation of two novel descriptors, the spin image and the RIFT descriptor. When affine invariance is not required, the original elliptical shape servee as an additional discriminative feature for texture recognition. The proposed approach is evaluated in retrieval and classification tasks using the entire Brodatz database and a publicly available collection of 1,000 photographs of textured surfaces taken from different viewpoints.},

abstract = {Over the last decade, several studies on texture analysis propose to model texture as a probabilistic pro- cess that generates small texture patches. In these studies, texture is represented by means of a frequency histogram that measures how often texture patches from a codebook occur in the texture. In the codebook, the texture patches are represented by, e.g., a collection of filter bank responses. The resulting represen- tations are called textons. A recent study claims that textons based on normalized grayvalues outperform textons based on filter responses (such as MR8 filter responses), despite the weaknesses of such image- based representations for image modelling. The paper investigates this claim by comparing image-based textons with textons obtained using the complex wavelet transform. The complex wavelet transform dif- fers from the MR8 and similar filters in that it employs filters with relatively low support and in that it constructs image representations with less redundancy. Furthermore, the paper investigates to what extent image-based textons are susceptible to 2D rotations of the texture. It compares image-based textons with rotation-invariant textons based on spin images and polar Fourier features. The performance of the new types of textons is evaluated in classification experiments on the CUReT texture dataset. The results of our experiments with the complex wavelet transform support the claim that filter-based textons do not outper- form their image-based counterparts. Furthermore, the results of our experiments reveal that image-based textons are very susceptible to 2D rotations of the texture, making image-based textons unapplicable to real-world texture classification problems. We show that strong rotation-invariant texton-based texture classifiers can be constructed by means of textons based on spin images and polar Fourier features.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES Liver volumetry has emerged as an important tool in clinical practice. Liver volume is assessed primarily via organ segmentation of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. The goal of this paper is to provide an accessible overview of liver segmentation targeted at radiologists and other healthcare professionals. METHODS Using images from CT and MRI, this paper reviews the indications for liver segmentation, technical approaches used in segmentation software and the developing roles of liver segmentation in clinical practice. RESULTS Liver segmentation for volumetric assessment is indicated prior to major hepatectomy, portal vein embolisation, associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) and transplant. Segmentation software can be categorised according to amount of user input involved: manual, semi-automated and fully automated. Manual segmentation is considered the "gold standard" in clinical practice and research, but is tedious and time-consuming. Increasingly automated segmentation approaches are more robust, but may suffer from certain segmentation pitfalls. Emerging applications of segmentation include surgical planning and integration with MRI-based biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS Liver segmentation has multiple clinical applications and is expanding in scope. Clinicians can employ semi-automated or fully automated segmentation options to more efficiently integrate volumetry into clinical practice. TEACHING POINTS • Liver volume is assessed via organ segmentation on CT and MRI examinations. • Liver segmentation is used for volume assessment prior to major hepatic procedures. • Segmentation approaches may be categorised according to the amount of user input involved. • Emerging applications include surgical planning and integration with MRI-based biomarkers.},

In this paper, we propose an approach for automatic segmentation of liver complex geometries. It consists of applying a graph-cut method initialized by an adaptive threshold. The algorithm has been tested on 10 datasets (CT and MR). A parametric comparison with the results obtained by previous algorithms based on active contour is also carried out and discussed. Main limitations of active contour approaches result to be overcome and segmentation is improved. Feasibility to routinely use graph-cut approach for automatic liver segmentation is also demonstrated.},

@article{Egger2014,
abstract = {In this contribution, a semi-automatic segmentation algorithm for (medical) image analysis is presented. More precise, the approach belongs to the category of interactive contouring algorithms, which provide real-time feedback of the segmentation result. However, even with interactive real-time contouring approaches there are always cases where the user cannot find a satisfying segmentation, e.g. due to homogeneous appearances between the object and the background, or noise inside the object. For these difficult cases the algorithm still needs additional user support. However, this additional user support should be intuitive and rapid integrated into the segmentation process, without breaking the interactive real-time segmentation feedback. I propose a solution where the user can support the algorithm by an easy and fast placement of one or more seed points to guide the algorithm to a satisfying segmentation result also in difficult cases. These additional seed(s) restrict(s) the calculation of the segmentation for the algorithm, but at the same time, still enable to continue with the interactive real-time feedback segmentation. For a practical and genuine application in translational science, the approach has been tested on medical data from the clinical routine in 2D and 3D.},

abstract = {The marching cubes method is a well-known surface extraction method by using the surface configurations of cubes for surface rendering of volume data. The marching cubes method has three main disadvantages: it is time consuming, ambiguous, and holes are generated. All these disadvantages come from the use of the surface configurations of cubes. We propose an efficient surface extraction method, the marching voxels method, for surface rendering of volume data. Instead of using the surface configurations of cubes, the marching voxels method first generates triangles for inner voxels. Then it combines the triangles of inner voxels to produce the surface of an object. Finally, the surface of an object is projected to a plane to form the final image. Since the marching voxels method considers the combination of triangles of voxels not cubes and the combination of triangles is performed in a deterministic way, there is neither ambiguous case of a combination nor holes for the generated surface. The experimental results show that the marching voxels method saves about 30{\%} of the surface rendering time compared to the marching cubes method for test samples},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Hypodense liver lesions are commonly detected in CT, so their segmentation and characterization are essential for diagnosis and treatment. Methods for automatic detection and segmentation of liver lesions were developed to support this task.

METHODS: The detection algorithm uses an object-based image analysis approach, allowing for effectively integrating domain knowledge and reasoning processes into the detection logic. The method is intended to succeed in cases typically difficult for computer-aided detection systems, especially low contrast of hypodense lesions relative to healthy tissue. The detection stage is followed by a dedicated segmentation algorithm needed to synthesize 3D segmentations for all true-positive findings.

RESULTS: The automated method provides an overall detection rate of 77.8{\%} with a precision of 0.53 and performs better than other related methods. The final lesion segmentation delivers appropriate quality in 89{\%} of the detected cases, as evaluated by two radiologists.

CONCLUSIONS: A new automated liver lesion detection algorithm employs the strengths of an object-based image analysis approach. The combination of automated detection and segmentation provides promising results with potential to improve diagnostic liver lesion evaluation.},

abstract = {Up to a fifth of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) present with synchronous hepatic metastases. In patients with CRC who present without intestinal obstruction or perforation and in whom comprehensive whole-body imaging confirms the absence of extrahepatic disease, evidence indicates a state of equipoise between several different management pathways, none of which has demonstrated superiority. Neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy is advocated by current guidelines, but must be integrated with surgical management in order to remove the primary tumour and liver metastatic burden. Surgery for CRC with synchronous liver metastases can take a number of forms: the 'classic' approach, involving initial colorectal resection, interval chemotherapy and liver resection as the final step; simultaneous removal of the liver and bowel tumours with neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy; or a 'liver-first' approach (before or after systemic chemotherapy) with removal of the colorectal tumour as the final procedure. In patients with rectal primary tumours, the liver-first approach can potentially avoid rectal surgery in patients with a complete response to chemoradiotherapy. We overview the importance of precise nomenclature, the influence of clinical presentation on treatment options, and the need for accurate, up-to-date surgical terminology, staging tests and contemporary management options in CRC and synchronous hepatic metastatic disease, with an emphasis on multidisciplinary care.},

@article{Fraser2012,
abstract = {We have developed a novel mapping software package to reconstruct microvascular networks in three dimensions (3-D) from in vivo video images for use in blood flow and O2 transport modeling. An intravital optical imaging system was used to collect video sequences of blood flow in microvessels at different depths in the tissue. Functional images of vessels were produced from the video sequences and were processed using automated edge tracking software to yield location and geometry data for construction of the 3-D network. The same video sequences were analyzed for hemodynamic and O2 saturation data from individual capillaries in the network. Simple user-driven commands allowed the connection of vessel segments at bifurcations, and semiautomated registration enabled the tracking of vessels across multiple focal planes and fields of view. The reconstructed networks can be rotated and manipulated in 3-D to verify vessel connections and continuity. Hemodynamic and O2 saturation measurements made in vivo can be indexed to corresponding vessels and visualized using colorized maps of the vascular geometry. Vessels in each reconstruction are saved as text-based files that can be easily imported into flow or O2 transport models with complete geometry, hemodynamic, and O2 transport conditions. The results of digital morphometric analysis of seven microvascular networks showed mean capillary diameters and overall capillary density consistent with previous findings using histology and corrosion cast techniques. The described mapping software is a valuable tool for the quantification of in vivo microvascular geometry, hemodynamics, and oxygenation, thus providing rich data sets for experiment-based computational models.},

@article{Ho2005a,
abstract = {In this paper, we present a new method for surface extraction from volume data which preserves sharp features, maintains consistent topology and generates surface adaptively without crack patching. Our approach is based on the marching cubes algorithm, a popular method to convert volumetric data to polygonal meshes. The original marching cubes algorithm suffers from problems of topological inconsistency, cracks in adaptive resolution and inability to preserve sharp features. Most of marching cubes variants only focus on one or some of these problems. Although these techniques could be combined to solve these problems altogether, such a combination might not be straightforward. Moreover, some feature-preserving variants introduce an additional problem, inter-cell dependency. Our method provides a relatively simple and easy-to-implement solution to all these problems by convening 3D marching cubes into 2D cubical marching squares, resolving topology ambiguity with sharp features and eliminating inter-cell dependency by sampling face sharp features. We compare our algorithm with other marching cubes variants and demonstrate its effectiveness on various applications. {\textcopyright} The Eurographics Association and Blackwell Publishing 2005.},

@article{Cebasek2010,
abstract = {Capillary supply of individual skeletal muscle fibers is usually evaluated from two-dimensional (2D) images of thin transverse sections by the number of capillary profiles around a fiber (CAF). This method is inherently inaccurate and the resulting capillary length measurement errors can be avoided by using an alternative three-dimensional (3D) approach where the mean length of capillaries around individual muscle fibers per fiber length (Lcap/Lfib) is measured from 3D images acquired by confocal microscopy. We quantified the error of the 2D method and its reduction by using a 3D approach in realistic geometrical models of muscle fiber capillary bed and in true muscle samples. In models we showed that Lcap/Lfib was sensitive to different arrangements of capillaries, while CAF underestimated capillarization since it could not detect the increased length of capillary bed. In true muscle samples, we detected statistically significant differences in the capillary supply of control and denervated rat soleus muscles by both 2D and 3D methods. Lcap/Lfib was larger than CAF in control muscles reflecting their more complicated capillary bed. Thus, 3D approach is more sensitive in agreement with the analysis of geometrical models. We conclude that the 3D method, though technically more demanding than 2D method, represents a more precise approach to evaluation of muscle capillarization. Moreover, the 3D method could be applied to other organs and we suggest potential medical applications.},
